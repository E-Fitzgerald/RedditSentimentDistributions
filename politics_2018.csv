The issue before the court is whether or not the those citizens have the right to determine how specific tax dollars are being spent.  The case law is clear.  Citizens do not have the right or authority to ear mark their tax dollars for specific budget line items or sue the State if they feel their tax dollars were incorrectly spent.

As to your last three points. I agree with you about the health care although I think there should be a compromise....perhaps Medicare for all with an option to purchase better policies? Socialized medicine is not without problems such as long wait times and ""death panels"". And paying our doctors less will only decrease the number and quality of med school applicants. 

War is hell, and it is sad to lose a child or partner or parent to what seems like a senseless battle....yet war is a fact of life on this planet. Military strength will ultimately keep us safe. I like system of a Downs BYOB, ""why do they always send the poor?"" , and this inequality does need to be addressed; maybe like israel we should all be required to serve. But I don't believe wars are fought to benefit the wealthy, nor do I believe that the other points you mentioned are for the benefit of the wealthy and nothing else. 

Do you honestly think we saved money by keeping Charles Manson in prison for decades rather than killing him for his heinous crimes?

In any case I think the death penalty will soon be a thing of the past. No drug companies want to supply drugs for lethal injection. Our whole prison system needs to be revamped. People shouldn't be jailed for minor drug offenses etc. 

These are important issues but they also deflect from the ongoing humanitarian crisis of the 13000 sentient viable late term preborn infants who meet painful deaths from dismemberment every year in the US. "
33," >You have to believe that the fetus is a living human being for it to be murder. Since there is no scientific consensus on that, 

Well yeah, there actually is. It's a scientific fact that when a human egg is fertilized by a human sperm, a new human being with its own unique DNA is created. Nothing further needs to be added. Like any living creature, it needs nutrition and shelter, and it will grow and develop along its genetically programmed continuum of life. The life of that unique person does begin at conception. 

 >it all comes down to your *religious belief* of when life begins.

There are pro life secularists, atheists, humanists, scientists, physicians, etc , all of whom agree on the fact that life begins at conception. 

The issue is not about when life begins; it's about when does that life have a ""value"" which would outweigh the consent of the being on which it temporarily relies for food and shelter. And this is where the religious issue comes into play. If one believes that all people have equal value, the right of that embryo to live would outweigh the bodily autonomy of the woman who must support that life. There is obviously cause for disagreement on that point. 

But the scales tip once the fetus becomes viable and can live outside the womb. At this point autonomy is not really an issue; the baby could be separated from the mom and nurtured by another source. This is where the late term abortion bans come into effect. 13000 babies a year lose their lives to this ""procedure "", and the vast majority of these abortions are not medically necessary. 

Edit. The death penalty argument is not relevant here. It serves only to detract from the real issue, which is the humanitarian crisis of these 13000 guiltless children. "
34," >Abortion is not murder.

Murder is defined as the intentional killing of one human being by another. Some definitions also include the word premeditation or ""malice aforethought"". 

It's a scientific fact that life begins at conception and therefore intentionally destroying that life is an act of murder. However there may be instances in which this might be permissible. 

 >That National Review article is full of misinformation about late-term abortions.

39,"> It's a scientific fact that when a human egg is fertilized by a human sperm, a new human being with its own unique DNA is created.

Well no, actually, that's an embryo. It's one cell. It has DNA unique from the parent and the potential to become a person down the line if many many many millions of things don't go wrong, but it has no more consciousness than any other cell in your body. 

Are you committing murder when you brush your hair, skin your knee, take antibiotics? All those single cells are just as alive as the embryo you cherish so highly above the rights, freedoms and liberties of women.

42,"Uh....I'm not sure where to start with this,but most of what you've said here is incorrect. This supports my point about how people need to be educated on this topic in order to develop an informed opinion. I try to do that here....Im a retired doctor and I post on this subreddit primarily to educate. 

You would really have to go back and look at basic biology. Bacteria are single celled organisms, and antibiotics do kill them; I guess you could call that murder if you're the bacteria police lol but we're discussing human life here, not microbial life. Skin cells and the other cells of your body are not organisms. *You* are the organism; your bodily cells are part of you. They all have your DNA. if you scrape your knee, your body makes new, genetically identical skin cells to replace the ones you lost. But your skin cells will always be skin cells....they do not contain the capacity to grow into anything else. Your body is made up of all sorts of cells, each with its own specialization, like different types of blood cells, nerve cells, etc. Every single one of them contains the same DNA, your DNA, which is present in all your cells. 

Sperm and eggs are a different category of cells called gametes. Each contains half as much of your DNA as your regular body cells. When egg and sperm get together, a new mix of DNA is created, half from each parent. This is the moment of conception, when a new human being is conceived. That very first cell is called a zygote. A zygote is a very special cell, not only because it's a new, unique being with its own DNA, but because it contains a blueprint for developing into an adult human. A zygote divides into more cells (blastocyst) which start to specialize and differentiate into different types, and then to form organs, and organ systems, of a human being. That tiny developing human is what you've referred to as an embryo. 

A full term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. By 8 weeks, all the baby's organs are developed, and only need to grow and mature. The baby's heart is beating and he has brain waves. It's really an amazing process, the whole study of embryology. Once the organs are formed (8-10 weeks), it's called a fetus not an embryo. All the fetus needs to do is grow and mature. 

So after about 22 weeks, the fetus is mature enough to live outside the womb with medical help. Im saying that this baby's life should be legally protected at that point, because he is no longer dependent on his mother's body to survive. 

I hope I've cleared up some of this about skin cells, bacteria, zygotes, embryos and fetuses. You're correct that a clump of cells has no more consciousness than any other cell in the body. But life is a continuum, and those bodily cells aren't going to grow into a new human being, as the zygote will. 

You say I cherish an embryo more than a woman's rights and that's true,  as far as I'm concerned. But  I can see where people can say the woman should give consent for that embryo to be there. However, once that fetus is developed enough to live outside the womb (22-24weeks), he is no longer dependent on her body. At that point the life of the baby outweighs the autonomy of the mother. "
43,"These things  are not mutually exclusive. Of course there can be an issue of errors that contribute to non viability. Nothing in this world is perfect. Life begins when an egg is fertilized; any number of things can happen after that, by which that new life can perish. That's how life on earth is.

321,"Just looked up Edward Luttwak. Looks like he's a Trump-asshole-licking whackjob who makes a lot of bad predictions and recommendations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Luttwak

> In his 2002 book Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard A. Posner said Luttwak ""writes well and with authority (that is, with an air of great confidence) and knows a lot—he is a serious historian and defense analyst"". ""But writing as a public intellectual, he repeatedly ventures predictions that events falsify. In 1983, he pronounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan a success. He also thought it likely that the Soviet Union would launch a limited war against China, especially if the West increased its military power (as it did in the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan). Years later, and indeed just a few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Luttwak was worrying that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika would augment the military power of the Soviet Union. Instead, those policies precipitated the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union"".

> Besides also citing Luttwak’s prediction, in response to a question, of the impoverishing of all but a small minority of Americans ""soon enough"", Posner wrote that Luttwak predicted, shortly before the first Persian Gulf War, that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would evacuate Kuwait ""after a week or two of bombing (the bombing continued for six weeks without inducing him to do so) and warned that the use of ground forces ‘could make Desert Storm a bloody, grinding combat with thousands of (U.S.) casualties.’ The ground fighting lasted only four days, rather than the minimum of two weeks that Luttwak predicted, and U.S. casualties were minimal. Writing a month into the bombing, Luttwak was no longer predicting heavy casualties but he still opposed a ground campaign. He thought it would lead inevitably to a military occupation of Iraq from which we would be unable to disengage without disastrous foreign policy consequences.""[4]

> Luttwak had made the casualties prediction in a Reuters article on August 23, 1990, in which he was quoted by reporter Jim Wolf as saying, ""Don't think that your precision weapons and your gadgets and your gizmos and your stealth fighters are going to make it possible to reconquer Kuwait without many thousands of casualties"".

> In a 2003 essay in The Next American Century: Essays in Honor of Richard G. Lugar (Rowman & Littlefield), Kenneth Adelman, a former director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, criticized such ""fear–mongering"" and added, ""As it happened, our 'gizmos' worked wonders"".[5]

> Most recently, Luttwak assessed the results of a Donald Trump presidency in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal arguing that ""his foreign policies are unlikely to deviate from standard conservative norms,"" withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, avoiding involvement in Syria and Libya, eschewing trade wars, and modestly reducing spending—in short, ""changes at the margin.""[6]"

330,"I was expecting a well reasoned argument from Foreign Policy.  I wasn't expecting to be convinced, but I was expecting to read some good points.  Instead:

>where almost 20 million inhabitants live within 35 miles of the armistice line. U.S. military officers have cited the fear of a “sea of fire” to justify inaction. But this vulnerability should not paralyze U.S. policy for one simple reason: It is very largely self-inflicted.

>When then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter decided to withdraw all U.S. Army troops from South Korea 40 years ago (ultimately a division was left behind), the defense advisors brought in to help — including myself — urged the Korean government to move its ministries and bureaucrats well away from the country’s northern border and to give strong relocation incentives to private companies. South Korea was also told to mandate proper shelters, as in Zurich for example, where every new building must have its own (under bombardment, casualties increase dramatically if people leave their homes to seek shelter). In recent years, moreover, South Korea has had the option of importing, at moderate cost, Iron Dome batteries, which are produced by both Israel and the United States, that would be capable of intercepting 95 percent of North Korean rockets headed to inhabited structures.  But over these past four decades, South Korean governments have done practically nothing along these lines. 

*""I told you assholes not to put the city of Seoul there, or at least to build some shelters so you could crawl out into the smoking ruins of your city.  But you didn't, so fuck you all, we're starting a war that will kill most of you.  Thanks for being our ally, and once again, fuck you.""*

Also, Iron Dome isn't really adequate to the challenge of an all out assault from a regular army.  [It costs about $100,000 per interception](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morris-iron-dome-disastrous-for-israel-20140822-story.html) and they simply can't load the launchers as fast as the North Koreans can fire thirty thousand artillery tubes.  If the North Koreans started firing artillery, counter battery fire could be launched before the first shells hit the ground, and along with that highly accurate artillery, the entire wrath of the USAF and thousands of pissed off South Korean infantrymen would rain down on the artillery.  But, for the short duration of that barrage, every iron dome rocket that has ever been built wouldn't stop 1% of it.

>Elected dictators have traits we should have learned after all this time to recognise in advance. They reject the conventions of democratic life. They will do anything to win power and tell any lie to retain it. They do not just want to beat their opponents but to destroy them and with them the possibility of change. To justify their assaults, they use the language of civil war. When their supporters turn to violence, they approve with winks and nods. When their opponents criticise, they are not citizens exercising their democratic rights but criminals spreading libel or treason – “enemies of the people”

White Protestants are already a religious minority. In the foreseeable future, whites will be an ethnic minority. Their anger at their loss of status may turn the Republican party into a franchise for the Trump brand. Republican suppression of black and immigrant votes may then allow it to retain power. Ballot rigging works well enough for Putin and Orbán, after all.

>They emphasise that America’s reconciliation after the civil war was based on the north allowing the south to disenfranchise African Americans. It was easier to maintain “civility” and “bipartisanship” when white supremacist southern Democrats rubbed along with country club Republicans. Reaction against the emancipation that the civil rights movement brought in the 1960s is as good a place as any to start in trying to understand the decadence of the American right.  
  
Reconstruction was not a maintenance of ""civility"" or ""bipartisanship"".  
my understanding is there were two camps:  
* Poeple mad that millions had died and absolutely foaming at the mouth to crush the south forever.  
* Poeple who thought enough had died and that restoring the rule of law was more important then vengeance.  
  
Its a travesty that the Party of Lincoln waves confederate flags but 3/5's was before the war and after it we had the 14th amendment. 1866 saw the first civil rights act passed overriding a veto, and an attempted impeachment of the man who veto'd it.(missed by one vote) 
And its fucking terrible that confederate soldiers went home and waited until the rage passed, got back into office and kept doing what they were doing before as best they could. I'm not sure mass execution of prisoners of war would have been the moral high-ground on that...  
Civil war was anything but.

At the very least giving her a serious look in the primary might get people to honestly decided once and for all if a celebrity politician is a good idea or not."

> “Star power only gets you so far without a real plan to tackle the wage gap and lift up working Americans,” she told Newsweek. “Trump didn’t win because he’s a celebrity— he won because his populist message resonated with Americans facing dwindling salaries and rising costs. The Democratic Party needs a candidate who can deliver a powerful message about income inequality, health care, and the struggles Americans are facing.”

I totally disagree with her assessment of why Trump won, but whatever.

A lot of people grew up hearing nothing but ""Hillary did this"" or ""we're investigating Hillary for that"" and just assumed because it had always been that way it's because she'd done something.

When really what started it was her daring to be a woman who came into the WH with her husband and wanting to take an active role. Republicans hated her from the beginning and because she also dared to not be cowed by them and stay in her place, they just kept on. To those (mostly) old, white, ""conservative"" men, shed representative of every woman who they see as stepping out of line. The fact that they couldn't break her and run her off just made them madder."
721,"> well then it's probably because she was surprisingly terrific as a candidate

Or maybe because a bunch of housewives decided to vote for someone they admire, regardless of how she actually compares to other candidates.

Remember, Trump emerged not only as the nominee but also as the president. We all know it wasn't because he was ""surprisingly terrific as a candidate"". We have easily led people on both sides who may vote with emotion rather than for who might actually make the best president. "
722,"> I also have trouble seeing how her presence in a crowded primary would be harmful.

Her being on stage with the rest of the real candidates absolutely sucks all of the oxygen out of the room.

There'd be no coverage of the other candidates, and whoever actually wins the candidacy goes into the general election as a completely unknown figure who has to build name recognition from  basically scratch."

724,">Or maybe because a bunch of housewives decided to vote for someone they admire, regardless of how she actually compares to other candidates.

Having the admiration of a *gigantic* block of voters and the ability to get them to the polls is one way to say ""terrific as a candidate."""
725,"I doubt that -- I don't think anyone emerges as a nominee without near universal name recognition.

I also don't think the Democratic electorate would actually nominate Oprah.  I don't think it's a bad thing, though, if she draws coverage to the Democrats and pulls attention that would probably otherwise go to MSM ""balancing"" stories Emailghazing the frontrunner "

The Dems should focus on taking the House in 2018 which would at least stem the flow of bad bills that make it to Trump's desk and try to find a viable candidate for 2020."
745,"tl;dr *I'm posting this article so it can be mocked despite the action of posting it giving it the exposure that the authors desire*

746,"I detest Trump. And this was an excellent article.

I'm so tired of *talking heads* spouting off about whether or not Trump has committed an ""impeachable offense"" - as though there is such an animal. There is not.

The Supreme Court has made clear that the definition of *impeachable offense* is whatever the majority of the House of Representatives say it is. In other words, if a simple majority vote in favor of Articles of Impeachment, then the President has, by definition, engaged in conduct constituting an impeachable offense. It is then up to the Senate to hold a trial to determine if he should be removed from office.

The Supreme Court made it clear in US v Nixon that, throughout it all, the Supreme Court does not engage in reviewing the vote of the House of Rep or the Senate. At the end of the day, because their votes are not reviewable, the process is an inherently political one, not a legal one. That is what this article was saying. And it is dead on right.

And which is why the 2018 elections are so important. Give the Democrats a simple majority and Trumpass gets impeached in the House. No President has ever been removed in the Senate and I seriously doubt Trump will either. But he may resign (I hope not - does any sane person seriously want a President Pence?). 

I am perfectly content with an outcome wherein Trump is impeached in the House and acquitted in the Senate - those two processes should consume the rest of his Presidency and allow a ""National Reset"" in 2020. 
"

749,This is a fact. impeachment is political. he is safe as long as the GOP holds both houses of congress. but this is energizing Dem voters and if they lose the house and senate you can bet your ass they will throw the book at trump
750,"1. Not everyone who reads political sites knows all of the ins an outs surrounding impeachment. Clarifying what it does and doesn't mean only feels like stating the obvious to those who are already aware of it.

2. Trump is in no *legal* trouble until after he's impeached (unless any of the floating state level stuff ever gets off the ground). As the head of the justice department, there's nobody to prosecute him until he's out of office, so all the focus on legal concerns is misguided at the present.

3. I don't see how this article would be condescending except to Trump's supporters "
751,"Depends both on the 2018 election and the results of Muellers probe. Until both of those pan out (or don't) impeachment is a ways off. If both fall favorably though, don't be so sure that the senate wouldn't be willing to convict.

756,"I could definitely see that. I was curious if they were claiming that the polls were not accounting for some hidden variable, similar to when people discount employment rates by asserting that the individuals that exit the job market aren't accounted for."
757,"What's worse than impeachment? Failed impeachment. See: Clinton. It will energize the ""victim's"" base. Clinton escaped conviction and saw his poll numbers rise. We don't go after Trump unless we get concrete evidence from Mueller that he obstructed justice. There's no way we'll have enough seats in the Senate to convict without Republican support, so Mueller's probe is crucial to our success."
758,"If they lose the house and senate, they won’t have the majority and won’t be able to do anything. "
759,"> Not everyone who reads political sites knows all of the ins an outs surrounding impeachment. Clarifying what it does and doesn't mean only feels like stating the obvious to those who are already aware of it.

This is a basic fact of impeachment. If he wanted to explain it why not quote the relevant potions of the stature?

Trump has multiple lawsuits currently against him and is about to be interviewed by Mueller. He certainly is not not in legal jeopardy. 

> All too many Democrats have pitched childish temper tantrums in response to conventional Republican reforms.

Anything my enemies disagree with is hysterical. There was no other word to use?"
760,"67 votes in the Senate just seems like an impossibly high bar.  Just get enough seats to neutralize his agenda and make sure not to lose in 2020.

My great fear is that by 2020 voters will have become numb to Trump outrage, his brand of 'leadership' will be normalized and folks won't turn out to vote.  I'm not sure that constantly talking about an impeachment that is probably not coming helps in that regard."
761,You said in another post that you admit that NRO is all opinion based. So why are you depressed in a sub that leans liberal people are downvoting a editorially biased site?
762,"It's something of a non-sequitur, but more specifically two points:

1. NRO is exclusively editorial content, so not sure how you grade journalism there...

2. There are plenty of NRO writers (David French, the author of this piece in particular) who have made their opposition to Trump known throughout his candidacy and into his presidency. I don't see how you can knock them for lack of integrity just for having different political opinions..."
763,"If you don't visit the site or read the articles, how would you even know that the articles misinform people? "
764,Exactly. you only get to accuse the president once.
765,"Sure. The point though is that just evidence of wrongdoing isn't enough. Clinton did actually commit perjury, but it wasn't enough to convict in the senate because the general public liked him and didn't think it was that big of a deal.

Similarly, Trump is definitely guilty of SOMETHING (as someone above mentioned the emolument clause stuff isn't even in question), so the question of whether he's impeached doesn't have much to do with the legal questions, but the political ones: how popular is he/do most people care. And that's where the much bigger danger for Trump is because most polling suggests that he's not only underwater, but crushingly so."
766,I highly doubt it. He only won by a small margin in 2016. In 2020 he would have had to improved markedly to best an angry Democrat wave. 
767,"Because most of the people aren't even bothering to read the article first. The way I see it, it's one thing to read an article, disagree with it or find it wanting and then downvoting it and another thing entirely to dismiss and downvote and article just because its source isn't from your side. 

One is critical thinking, the other is building yourself an echo chamber."
768,"It doesn't take long to find examples of their lack of integrity. Here's their, completely disingenuous, top-headline http://www.nationalreview.com/article/455196/scott-pruitt-epa-reform-crusade
Here's some factual reporting https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa.html.
NRO is purposefully keeping their audience misinformed. "
769,"David French has been going all in on the ""discredit the Muller investigation"" lately.  He plays a ""Never Trump"" conservative, but is all-in when it comes to the actual policies he enacts.  He just doesn't like the optics of Trump.

I particularly like this bit he recently wrote:

>""But so far evidence of actual collusion is thin on the ground. Neither Mueller’s indictments nor his guilty pleas have disclosed any evidence of actual cooperation between Russians and the Trump campaign. Yes, there is disturbing evidence that Donald Jr., Manafort, and Kushner seemed willing and eager to receive damaging information from the Russians even after being told it was part of a Kremlin plan to help their candidate. **But so far there’s no publicly available evidence that anything came of those contacts.**""

How is questioning someone's mental state worse than criminalizing differences? It isn't. How is this a conversation about political differences? It isn't. No one questions Trump's mental state because he is a proponent of trickle down economics. We question his mental state because he acts the way he acts, tweets the way he tweets, etc. What did Russia come up for? The most likely reason is that Trump is under investigation for his campaign's involvement with Russian political interference. Invoking Russia into this non-Russian conversation only serves to add more noise to the attacks against the investigation from my point of view. The first statement in the article is unreasonable.

>""The psychiatrist-ization of political difference is much more dangerous. It's what they did in Russia, it's what they did in China, it's what they did in an apartheid South Africa. If you don't like a candidate, first lock them up. If you can't lock him up, commit him to a mental hospital.""

He didn't say it was based on no evidence, he said:

>Yale Professor Bandy Lee earlier this month briefed several congressional Democrats and one Republican earlier this month over her concerns over the president's mental state, and Dershowitz said her comments that he is dangerous and may need to be restrained from action are in themselves dangerous.

>""Imagine how dangerous that would be, and you know, psychiatrists are notoriously bad at predicting violence,"" said Dershowitz.

>""Remember, what they are looking at are things they knew about since he was elected president,"" Dershowitz added. ""I didn't like what I saw necessarily so I did what you do in a democracy, you vote for the candidate you prefer, I preferred Hillary Clinton. I knew about her, I knew about him. I made a balanced judgment. You don't lock them up. You don't put them in mental hospitals if you don't agree with them. So dangerous to democracy.""


>Meanwhile, the 25th Amendment is designed to be used to remove a president who is incapacitated.

>""[It] is designed for when somebody has a stroke or somebody is unconscious, perhaps what happened when President [Woodrow] Wilson was president,"" said Dershowitz. ""He had a serious stroke. It's not designed for differences about a person's emotional makeup.""

Again, he never argued that you have no right to question his sanity... he is talking about the idea that you are going to use the 25th amendment to remove him from office because of the way he speaks, or his emotional temperment, or even his ""possible"" psychiatric condition, is dangerous."
928,Criticizing some Democrats isn't the same as supporting Trump.
929,">How is questioning someone's mental state worse than criminalizing differences? It isn't. 

It isn't ""questioning"" that he has an issue with, it is claiming that your political opponents are insane.  And then using that declaration to get them locked up.  Why is it worse?  Possibly because it completely ignores the rule of law and the presumption of innocence by directly claiming that people you disagree with are a danger to society.  In any case, that is his opinion versus your opinion, and his is as reasonable as yours.

>How is this a conversation about political differences? It isn't.

Later in the same appearance he shows what some of this psychiatrists complaints were, including Trump's decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem.  But even ignoring that piece, the entire thing is based on political differences.  The left does not like the way he speaks, his bluntness, or his propensity to threaten dictators who threaten us.  He isn't staring at a wall and drooling... he is making decisions and taking stances that the left disagrees with.

>We question his mental state because he acts the way he acts, tweets the way he tweets, etc.

Exactly.  He acted that way and tweeted that way before he was elected.  Therefore, what Dershowitz is saying in the aggregate is precisely true - Liberals are trying to undo democracy by psychiatriazing their enemies.  IE, ""He's insane he can't be President!"", after they lost an election in which he presented the exact same behavior to the electorate.

No, the most likely reason is because Dershowitz actually worked against that during his career, and liberals are currently using Stalinist techniques."

Again, my bad.  He said ""accuse"" not question.  Again, my point still stands.  Why can't liberals make an accusation regarding Trump's sanity in a free and democratic society?  They way it's supposed to work is that the facts will persuade those of us who are reasonable one way or the other on the issue.  It doesn't mean accusations should never be leveled to a President?"
936,"Sure, but he is criticizing Democrats’ objectively true criticisms and statements about Trump. You can’t define that in any other way than supporting Trump in defiance of reality. "
937,"We seem to be on different pages here. Where I see random people saying things on TV, you see the leaders of the non-Trump party. I am going to address this from that lens in the hopes that we can find an understanding.

Trump has not been locked up, nor has anyone close to the leadership of the non-Trump party suggested anything close to that. It is completely unreasonable to bring such a ridiculous idea into this conversation.The leader of the Trump party HAS suggested that his political opponents be locked up (remember the chant?) and has pushed his DoJ to investigate his former political opponent (remember how she doesn't exist in the political sphere anymore?).

I don't think that ""some psychiatrists"" have any influence. They have every right to complain about Trump's shortsighted decision to announce moving our embassy into disputed territory. The problem with the way he speaks is far more than bluntness. He isn't even blunt. Most of what he says has to be ""clarified"" by his handlers. He threatens everyone because that is all he knows. Bullies are like that. Granted, he rarely follows through because that too is how bullies act. He isn't making decisions. He is yelling things that he hopes someone else will bring into existence (remember that DO SOMETHING tweet?).

Again, the leaders of the non-Trump party are not trying to undo democracy. Based on what you're saying in your response I am not sure that you are being honest with your opinions. Trump is currently the person sworn to protect our Constitution but is trying to defy it on multiple fronts. If you cared about the loss of democracy in our country you would express shock at some of those things. You do not seem to care. Additionally, if he acted the same way before the election, he was unfit to the people pointing out his lack of fitness at that time as well. 

Russia and China are not communist states. China is a communist state. Neither country has to go through the process of assessing their leader's fitness for office.

Whoever ""These psychiatrists"" are. . . You really care about their opinions. That's fair. Their opinions are opinions. As we can all see, there has been no movement by the leaders of the non-Trump party in regard to the words of ""These psychiatrists"".

What actually happened is that Democrat Senators and Congressmen summoned a Psychiatrist who has never met, or treated Donald Trump, to capitol hill to testify on why he is insane and should be forcibly removed from office.

That's what actually happened, and what he is talking about.

He isn't talking about Joe Democrat and Bob Liberal in the front yard talking about how crazy the President is.  He is talking about official efforts by the political class, backed up by the 24/7 media coverage, to have an elected President forcibly removed from office.

That's right... the Democrat Party is actively summoning and debriefing psychiatrists who have no connection to the President, in order to form a case for having him removed from office.

Your post is filled with inaccuracies, but this seems to be the most relevant one.  If you aren't aware of what he is talking about, then how can you judge his opinions as unreasonable?

In short, a few of your other inaccuracies:

Clinton isn't being attacked because she is a political opponent, but rather because she is a criminal who was let off the hook by a totally corrupt FBI and Obama Administration.

Trump has been consistently restoring our adherence to the Rule of Law, and you will be unable to show me on he is defying the Constitution ""on multiple fronts"".

Democracy does not mean agreement.

Russia is absolutely a communist nation.

Complaining about a decision he made, and claiming that in your professional opinion it makes him insane and unfit for the position, are two entirely different things.  In fact, this difference is what Dershowitz is TRYING to explain to you.

His fitness for office was already assessed, by the electorate, who chose him to be President.  Using the irresponsible opinion of a few doctors in an effort to forcibly remove him from office is the current strategy of the Democrat party, and it is dangerous, and undemocratic.

Once again, this is what Dershowitz was trying to say to you."

>What exactly should our elected officials do in a situation such as this? 

A situation where the President of the United States is using his legal and constitutional authority to negotiate with foreign powers, in his own unique style?

Nothing.  They should give advice and consent on any treaties he brings to them, and consider any requests for declaration of war that he makes.  That is their job.

edit: not left out, just placed at the very bottom and I missed it. Everyone that railed against trump's tax plan and is now pushing oprah should take a look at that.  Billionaires will always look after their interest and not those of the working class. "
1071,"WHO CARES???? I don’t want another rich celebrity with no experience. Look how well it’s working out right now. Stop trying to make this a thing. First the rock, now oprah. Please stop. "
1072,We don't care. Stop trying to make Oprah 2020 a thing.
1073,"So people are serious about this Oprah thing. Well, here comes Trump’s second term."
1074,">Winfrey has also spoken out about how she survived childhood abuse, and testimony to Congress in 1991 helped push through the “Oprah bill,” or the National Child Protection Act, which created a national database of convicted child abusers.

To people who think she has no experience.  "
1075,"So she’s a far left lib legal that supports gun control, amnesty for illegals, and pretending gender is not based on X and Y chromosomes. 

I seriously hope she runs. These policies did wonders for Republicans when we picked up over 1,000 seats under Obama and when we beat Hillary in 2016. "
1076,It is verifiably Russian trolls. 
1077,"OP posts in /r/WayOfTheBern which is an outlet for Russian propaganda targeting the far left, so they are a likely unwitting asset."
1078,Are they saying good things or trying to tear down a Dem who scares them?
1079,"Of course not, Ryan or Pence will be president next.  She will be the next one elected"
1080,She supports gay marriage and gay rights.  She been doing that since the 90s.  I guess reading the article was to much for you
1081,It's at the bottom of the article. 
1082,Oprah isn't even serious with the Oprah thing.  This is a made thing people are pretending exists.  
1083,Trump won't even win his primary in 2020
1084,She herself doesn't want to run. She literally has said it multiple times on TV.  She is not a politician and doesn't want to be. 
1085,I thought they banned all you guys in the hate sub purge. 
1086,Because giving testimony of events that happened to her gives qualifies her for public office? Since when?
1087,"That's the whole strategy: fan up animosity and anger on both sides of an issue and let Americans distract themselves fighting over bullshit, and creating animosity that spills over into substantive issues. We know that those kinds of accounts did so with Black Lives Matter. 

Don't take the bait."
1088,"As I have said elsewhere, Putin would LOVE an Oprah presidency. Goodbye international credibility forever. Nobody wants to form strategic alliances with a partner who will elect unqualified novelty baubles for the foreseeable future."
1089,"

i could live with that implication"
1090,"Trump said HE supported gay rights and we see how that worked out.  Pay no attention to her words, pay attention to the FACT that she actively supports, fawns over and publicizes two of the biggest gay bashing bigots in the US."
1091,She will run. 
1092,What are you talking about
1093,That is not the only thing she has done.  
1094,"That's just ignoring everything she has done for gay rights.  

I don't give a shit about the views of her preacher, I went down this racist road before with Obama.  It never matters what a white man's preacher says, or the Catholic Church.  They will hate gays.  
She doesn't hate gays, she was literally the first person to gave Ellen's back when she came out in the 90s, has always supported gay rights.  "
1095,"So let me get this straight. She herself has said multiple times she is not running and being president wouldn't be a strength of hers but yet you truly believe she is running. 

“I will never run for public office,” she said. “That’s a pretty definitive thing. ... And I don’t know [if I could beat Trump]. I don’t know the answer to that. I will never have to know the answer to that because I will never run for public office.” ~Oprah"
1096,"So...why was that your go-to example for citing her experience? Just seems like if you were trying to preempt arguments, you would cite the achievement that most qualifies her to hold public office, right?"
1097,"Yet it's the example you gave 

Until you give better, I remain unimpressed"
1098,"It matters very MUCH to me what a white man's preacher says especially if that white man is a billionaire who has the power to enrich, publicize and give national television shows to anti-gay bigots like Oprah has done and is doing."
1099,She will run. Don't be tricked. 
1100,What?  It's from the article. What do you mean go to?  You think this is some conspiracy?
1101,Read the article.  Might help you comprehend things better
1102,"She is not anti gay.  It's like saying Hillary Clinton is anti gay.  You will gave every gay person going 'bullshit, I watched her show' "

1106,OMG! Who is stupid enough to think the wall will stop illegal immigration? It is a stupid idea. 
1107,Not a chance the Democrats are going to allow the DACA people to be used as pawns. There's not going to be any wall.
1108,"Fuck that shit.

Trump took away DACA to use as a bargaining chip for exactly this situation.

Cave now and he'll do the same fucking thing again and again."
1109,This just proves how fucking shit america has become. It seems fucking ego wall is more important than human right of the people.  I have lost every bit of respect toward Usa.
1110,Are Democrats actually going to cave on the wall? The WALL?
1111,And not Mexico 
1112,Figure out how to prevent Trump from illicitly profiting from his wall and he will lose all interest in it. 
1113,"So fucking annoying how Democrats never fucking stand up. Like cmon for fucking once stop the ""Ideal Parenting Magazine's Non-Conflict, Conflict Defusing Techniques"" and just fucking go for the throat!

""HEY DONALD YOUR FUCKING WALL IS LIKE YOUR AND MELANIA'S SEX LATER! IT AINT GONNA HAPPEN BRO!"""

1116,More than half of our undocumented immigrants arrive via airplane. This wall must be yuge!
1117,"It will curtail it DRAMATICALLY. 

Do you know the border patrol caught over 300,000 (!) people crossing over from mexico last year? And that was the lowest number in decades.

Imagine how many people werent caught! I mean, how good do you think the border patrol is? 

We need The Wall! We deserve The Wall! We will have The Wall!"
1118,"At least with a wall its possible to mitigate and cheese what ""caving"" means at worst we waste 4 billion over 2 years building, impeaching, canceling, and tearing down. If that's all it would take to save DACA I'd call that a bargain unfortunately that's likely not all it would take."

We can't wait until 2019 to pass a clean DACA bill after the democratic gains in congress. The wall will take years and years to build and can be scrapped and the money taken from it as soon as trump is gone.

People who give a shit about the plight of the DACA recipients won't remember this as a trump win, but as trump being a bully and using them as hostages to trump's xenophobic fantasy of border security."
1122,"You see, this is how Mexico is paying for the wall. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals...of Mexican immigrants will allow him to get this stupid wall. Mexico, however, will get the last laugh as smart people the world over will think the US is unstable and stupid and probably start immigrating to places like Mexico. Hopefully, they decriminalize drugs and make the place safer for foreigners so they can take advantage of a braintrust."

1127,"Given current estimate of the cost of the wall that comes out to over $70,000 per person. And I’m sure cost overruns will be massive. And then there is maintenance and hiring all the people to man the wall. This whole idea is just dumb. Do the math. 
If we really wanted cut down on illegal immigration we should go after the people hiring undocumented workers. Problem solved. "
1128,"Never give in to bullies.
"
1129,"I agree with this. We've already seen that Trump is perfectly OK with declaring that Obamacare has been 100% repealed through the tax bill, even though it wasn't.

Then there was that thing with him asking the Mexican president to work with him and just say something that will let him tell the American people that Mexico will play ball. They didn't do it, but Trump seemed interested only in the appearance of being able to say something that would appeal to his base.

I don't put it past him to get some language in whatever they do with DACA that lets him say ""and the Democrats have agreed that the wall will finally be built!""

Of course, it never will be. "
1130,"sounds reasonable if they tap rolling back the tax cuts a tiny bit to pay for it, and basically do that every time republicans want to burn money in the future"
1131,"it's irrelevant since they knew it was going to pass. 

by all voting against it, they claim the higher ground .. all the while they probably are delighted it passed bc (i) more american suffer the better their chances next election, and (ii) a lot of them personally benefit from the cuts too."
1132,"Yeah, that ""they go low we go high"" stuff was such BS. All it does is make you look like a giant hypocrite when you inevitably sling mud.

I just wish Dems had a candidate who could *actually* stand tall and compete with the Right on insults in a high-caliber comedian kind of way. I wish the Left could meme too."
1133,Its time to start calling the republican wives on speaker phone and talking some locker room talk. 
1134,[removed]
1135,TIL every wall in existence is just an useless piece of stone unable to stop any trespasser. 
1136,predictable behavior we shouldn't blindly trust in such crutches we should take each issue case by case

1141,lack of school. lord of the rings was a documentary.
1142,"Wall technology has progressed a bit in the last 500 years.  
30 years ago, we saw the last attempt at at completely impenetrable border wall - and it was remarkably effective, especially if you don't include the section that ran straight through a  metropolis.  
Now imagine what's possible today with neural networks, drones and ADS heat ray systems.  
I'd be surprised if the number of successful border crossings a year reached double digits."

1147,Textbook concern trolling.
1148,I didn't say anything about reading.
1149,"East Germany paid about 1.8 billion mark for all of their border fortifications between 1961 and 1964.  
Determining the value of a currency used in socialistic states is kind of difficult, but since the monthly income of an average worker tripled between 1960 and 1990 and the black market exchange rate in 1990 was 10:1, it's reasonable to say that the exchange rate in 1960 was 3:1. That brings us to the expetiture of 600 million D-Mark - that's about 150 million USD (1.2 billion in 2017), with the construction of the wall included.   
The border was about 900 miles long, so it's about half of the length of our border with Mexico.  
Considering that the wall will be cheaper to construct in some regions due to the Rio Grande and won't require as much manual labour, we can reasonably expect that it will cost about a 2 billion dollars per year - and it will get cheaper over time, as the maintenance is much lower than the construction costs.  
2 billion dollars is a bit less than 0.05 percent of our federal budget. I couldn't find any federal government agency small enough to compare it with, but to put this number into perspective, consider that the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin has a market cap of one billion USD."
1150,"Not at all, I've just been in a bit of a funk. I've been feeling very pessimistic recently. I suppose I allowed myself to hope that after the tax bill the GOP would be more openly anti Trump and instead they seem to be circling the wagons."

She didn't always use her platform responsibly: she helped elevate snake oil salesmen like Dr. Oz. Etc. Etc. Etc.

But she *also* hasn't had multiple bankruptcies. She isn't a white supremacist. She hasn't been sued by the justice department twice for unfair business practices. She didn't spend 8 years perpetuating a racist lie about the president. She appears to acknowledge basic facts about the world, including on climate change. She hasn't committed serial sexual assault and bragged about it on tape. She actually runs the businesses with her name on them rather than licencing said name, and she has had success in multiple competitive areas--TV (where, again, she had creative control over her show in a way that Trump did not), magazines, and cable. She actually *does* read books. Etc. etc. etc.

In all of these quantifiable ways, she is a better candidate for ""celebrity president"" than Trump.

Her positions on those issues are both more consistent and more deliberately stated than any of Trump's were in, say, 2013. She wouldn't be my first choice in 2020--for a lot of reasons!--but if she stuck to these planks and then literally flipped a coin on every other issue, she'd be head-and-shoulders better for progressive causes than Trump.

That's you, man. The fact that some desperate Democrats have mentioned the possibility of Oprah says nothing about our revulsion for Trump, which had less to do with his experience and more to do with his history of being a self-interested, semi-competent (at best), racist, sexist, criminally corrupt asshole. 2000 Candidate Trump was received far differently than 2016 Candidate Trump, because 2000 Candidate Trump hadn't spent the run up to the election spouting racist lies about the president, Etc. etc. etc.

Biden: Not a bad candidate, but not sure he would get a lot of support from progressives. Also is tied to Obama, which Trump obviously has talking points for.

Warren: Would have progressive support. Also has blind hate towards her, similar to Hillary. That worries me. 

Harris: Seems to be a rising star, so it will be interesting to see how the next few years play out. At the moment she has pretty low name recognition though. 

Booker: Gets attacked a lot for his financial ties, that could really hurt him. 

Oprah: Giant name recognition. Would suck the air out of the room and control news cycles like Trump. No experience, and after the shit show of Trump I don't think people will want to try that experiment again.

Gillibrand: Gaining some name recognition and speculation. Her feuds with Trump and how outspoken she has been in the #metoo movement are helping. 

Sherrod Brown: I think he is a really interesting candidate. Not much name recognition, but has a lot of progressive populism to him. I could see him really rising and being popular with the white working class.

When Jeff Bezos flies to Vienna for vacation and crashes the Euro, I'll believe it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_I_of_Mali#Islam_and_pilgrimage_to_Mecca"
1237,No...This means his net worth in context of the US economy means he owns about 1/10th of 1% of the US net worth. There have been individuals in history who have held a FAR greater share of their society's wealth.
1238,Cue Trump Twitter meltdown about the failing Amazon/ Washington Post
1239,"Lol, Bill Gates barely has 91 billion, he's practically a beggar now"
1240,"Nope ,Putin is. "
1241,"Didn't Mensa Musa crash the price of gold by giving it out for free throughout North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula? Comparing Jeff Bezos to the world economy he is still a relatively small part of it because we are dealing with trillions that consist of thousands of billions.

There were single people who had a ridiculous grip on the entire world economy in ancient times."
1242,[Obligatory](https://imgur.com/r/funny/BfZ6roy)
1243,"I saw once, when adjusted for inflation, John Rockefeller was the richest man ever."
1244,What about Mansa Musa? Midas for real.
1245,Considering I use his products daily its hard hate on his wealth.
1246,I was watching a documentary on the east India company and that they had the highest market cap in history in real dollars (as accurate as one can extrapolate inflation that far back)
1247,"Vladimir Putin is almost certainly richer in real dollar terms.  In terms of percentage of wealth of a society, not doubt any Egyptian Pharaoh, or most any monarch, would be ahead.  As a percentage of the world's wealth, Genghis Khan was probably the richest ever.  Khan also killed about 10% of the human population, and fathered at least 0.5% of the current population.
"
1248,Only because he's given so much away.
1249,This is probably the correct answer.
1250,"Historic wealth, particularly from pre-market economies, is hard to compare to present times. I'm not saying the Mensa Musa was not wealthy, its just the concept of wealth is an abstraction when preponderance of economic activities took place without the exchange of currency."
1251,Not a bad ratio
1252,"Him and Warren Buffett.  I used to think Gates was pure evil back in the 90s and early 00s, but I've changed my mind.  It gives me hope to think that not all rich people are complete douchenozzles who want to screw over the poor and needy. "
1253,">Musa made his pilgrimage between 1324–1325.[18][19] His procession reportedly included 60,000 men, including 12,000 slaves[20] who each carried 1.8 kg (4 lb) of gold bars and heralds dressed in silks who bore gold staffs, organized horses, and handled bags. Musa provided all necessities for the procession, feeding the entire company of men and animals.[21] Those animals included 80 camels which each carried 23–136 kg (50–300 lb) of gold dust

This wasn't 'barter economy' 'can't translate goods to currency' wealth, this was **30 tons of gold**.  And that was just the gold, I'm leaving out the slaves, servants, and beasts.

Also: this wasn't the sum total of his wealth, this was just the portion of his wealth he brought with him on the pilgrimage to Mecca.

Fucker was rollin' in it, is what I'm saying."
1254,Bill Gates is for sure the best kind of rich person 
1255,Bill gates kicked his addiction to making money. He was just as cutthroat and greedy as Mark Zuckerberg etc during the dotcom boom. Personally I see his philanthropy and efforts to get other billionaires to give away their money similar to how recovering alcoholics or drug addicts are always keeping in touch with each other and trying to encourage each other to stay clean.
1256,"He certainly was loaded as the absolute monarch of what was probably the world's largest gold producing area at that date of time. But you fall into the same situation for every absolute monarch of large and prosperous empires. Is it Manu Musa's wealth of that of his empire's? 

Also having so much gold that it collapses the value of gold for a decade kind of undercuts its relative value. 30 tons of gold is alot of money in any era, but we can price it out and its not the largest fortune in human history.

1257,"Not politics.

But yeah, probably. He was prominent when booth babes were a thing, so... sorta not surprising."
1258,Oof. That’s rough.  Although I don’t think you’re gonna take down guys like Spider-Man and the X-men due to this.
1259,Thwip!

Any case I am shocked and a bit saddened."

1320,Lol am American and I doubt he won’t be fucked by the end of this investigation. At the least 90% of the world will have empirical evidence that shows how much of a crook he is and how much his campaign had worked with a foreign government to  get elected. Republicans may be blissfully ignorant to these facts. But the world will know. And we will not forget. 
1321,"That's only according to Morning Consult, the only poll that's even more favorable to Trump than Rasmussen.  *Rasmussen.*  And they couldn't even get a majority in this poll for the position pushed.

That said, I don't think that's what's going to happen."

1397,"""Humiliated"" might be a strong word.  She had to have the DNC putting their thumb on the scale to edge Bernie out, then she lost to Donald Trump.  The only person that should feel humiliated in that scenario is Hillary.  There were plenty of very visible ""im with her"" people here back then, anyway.

I know you're strongly anti-sanders, and you like to promote the idea that people not wanting Oprah to be president is somehow ""anti-woman"" and ""anti-black"" sentiment, rather than ""anti-tv personality in the whitehouse"" sentiment, but you're talking about many of the same people who voted for obama, twice, myself included, so if you pull that 'anti black' bs with me, you're barking up the wrong tree.  I'd take Kamala Harris any day of the week over Oprah.  I'll take Kamala Harris over pretty much anyone I've seen the DNC pushing... Hillary or Biden included."
1398,"No-one says that. I think the nomination is still Bernie's if he's healthy enough. Nobody is angry at Bernie, unlike Jill Stein."

>Some community groups have been pressuring the foundation to sign a contract guaranteeing jobs and other amenities to residents who live nearby. Obama has said he will not sign a community benefits agreement.
Monday’s announcement comes as a group of University of Chicago professors, faculty and staff have written a letter, electronically signed by more than 120 people, asking that the entire presidential center be moved from Jackson Park to another location. First, there are concerns that the Obama Center as currently planned will not provide the promised development or economic benefits to the neighborhoods. Because the current plans place the Center next to the Museum of Science and Industry and across the street from the University of Chicago campus, there is no available adjacent land in which to start a new business, set up a new café or restaurant, bring another cultural center to the neighborhood. It looks to many neighbors that the only new jobs created will be as staff to the Obama Center, hence the widespread support for a Community Benefits Agreement. "

And if, politically, he is considered to be unable to perform the duties of President, if he is considered unable to perform the job of the leader of the USA, if he is considered to be creating a clear and present danger to the population of the USA (let alone the rest of the world), then impeachment is ***exactly*** the correct process to use to move him out of that position of leadership.

It needs a majority ***from both parties*** to succeed, and if both parties agree that he and his actions are bad and/or dangerous for the nation (and the world), then that is good enough to dump him."

Yes dont face discrimination with laws or regulations, face it with less laws and regulations."
1489,">Unfortunately, a review of states and countries with government-mandated paid leave programs indicates they harm young women, whether they're available to fathers or not. This is because parental leave policies are associated with an increase in leave-taking and childbearing, which leads to lost labor or increased health care costs for companies. As a result, employers may assume women will cost more to employ than before the policy, and company decisions to hire, promote, train or pay women less can reflect that, at women's expense.

You're being disingenuous here. The increase in the standard deduction will mean a lot more people won't benefit from itemizing, and the loss of the state tax deduction and mortgage deduction won't matter. A standard deduction of $24000 will cover households in all but the most highly taxed states. If your state is taxing you that heavily, that's a state issue, and needs to be dealt with at the state level. Federal tax law shouldn't be written to cater to people in a couple of high tax states (I'm looking at you CA and NY) at the expense of the rest of us.  

The statement about insurance is simply wild speculation, and the vast majority of the people in the country get insurance through their employer, which isn't effected as much. People buying insurance on the exchanges (and I was one of them until very recently) may take a hit, but honestly the mandate wasn't working, and the prices weren't stabilizing as everyone hoped they would.

1580,"It is almost like people are complex...

I do not like the way he handled the Clinton investigation, but I don't think he handled it in a way that was inherently wrong or immoral. As a matter of fact, I think the way he went public was inline with what he felt was right. He told Congress that the issue was closed, and then there was something that came up that made the issue not closed. It turned out to be nothing, but I understand why he told Congress the issue was reopened. 

Comey is a good man, one that dedicated years of service to this country. I can be kinda perturbed with what he did without saying he was immoral or unethical. 

Comey deserved better than what he got from Trump. 
"
1581,"The only liberals who hated Comey for what went down before the election are those who are misinformed and don't know how it really went down.

Comey was under a legal obligation to update congress and was just doing his job when he sent them his letter on the Clinton investigation.  Chaffetz, that lying, stinking, traitorous rat, leaked it to the public and should face Hatch Act violations but won't.  Anyone who jumped on the Comey hate train was uninformed and reactionary.  He is a true patriot and I can't wait to take my future children to his monument one day. "
1582,"because there wasn't enough context in the madness of the election to understand what he was doing publishing his memo. I still disagree with his choice to publish a thing about re-opening the investigation, since it was misunderstood by millions as some kind of re-incrimination of Clinton, but I understand his explanations later on about how he was in a difficult situation where there wasn't a clean solution, since he knew the FBI would get reamed by the public if it turned out they were secretly re-investigating Clinton's investigation through emails on Weiner's laptop without making a public statement about it.

1594,"Just think if the shoe had been on the other foot.

A few days before the election, Comey had received some intel that gave the Steele Dossier more credibility. He doesn't know if it was worthwhile or junk, but he doesn't have time to validate it until maybe election day, maybe even after.

How would history have judged him if he didn't warn someone? If he didn't let Congress know that, hey, we've got something here that may be nothing, but may be something?

Yes, it was clearly an underhanded tactic to discredit Clinton, but not by Comey. By those that held onto the worthless info until days before the election and put him in the position to say nothing and be thought a fraud or say something and be thought a fraud."
1595,"i don't know if it was a mistake really, it's looking like Donnie's Game plan was to project all his illegalities onto President Clinton and the EVENTUAL leak that Comey didn't address the new information would make him look politicized and could damage the new administration greatly. He either took a risk to avoid problems at the back end (and thought that Hillary would win anyway), or did it because he thought he had them dead to rights after the fact. 

After all that has happened and come out in the last year, its ludicrous to say Comey was trying to damage the Clinton campaign with his actions in 2016."

That doesn't impact my ability to understand that Trump fired him thinking it would make his problems go away."

His job isn't to put people in jail, it's for the FBI to investigate to determine if there is enough evidence to determine if a crime was committed, and the intention of the actions to also help determine, then provide that information to the DOJ.

1622,"> he was kind of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't

I actually disagree with this. I believe Comey's great failing is holding his technical interpretation of FBI policy over his greater moral obligation to stop Trump. Comey was in a position to understand that Trump was a truly evil, compromised, and unqualified candidate, and that his crimes were not comparable to those of Clinton.

Comey was thinking ""what is the best technical interpretation of the rules,"" when he should have been thinking, ""how do I interpret the rules to expose Trump for what he is.""

I do not believe a legalistic view of professional ethics is the highest moral calling, as Comey may. There is a truer, more basic form of morality that supersedes his professional responsibilities. It is based on basic concepts like honesty, respect, and decency. Trump so obviously failed at this. Comey should have used his office and his knowledge to expose Trump's failure to the American people. While he should not have covered for Clinton, he absolutely could have interpreted his responsibilities differently and not made that press release so close to the election.

So no, I don't think Comey was ""damned if you do, damned if you don't."" Comey could have acted differently and shifted history towards a better outcome. Instead he damned us. 

I am willing to forgive him, but I won't sugarcoat it. He made a big mistake, and the world will suffer greatly for it. When Comey dies, all the good he can ever do will be vastly outweighed by a single action which has and continues to lead to great suffering and missed opportunities."
1623,"> was all on the GOP for leaking it.

Perhaps, but it was also 100% predictable. Comey could have justified avoiding or delaying the letter."
1624,At least that's the narrative all the right wing news was pushing. 
1625,"I suppose part of the issue is labels themselves. I mean, if a label were applied to me I supposed I'd be labeled moderate. There's stuff on either side of the spectrum I agree with and disagree with. Yet a conservative would label me a liberal. A liberal definitely wouldn't label me a liberal.

I think I also have a pretty good ability to say ""Well, if I take their view into consideration I can come up with a really good compromise that works well for everyone"". Like free college for instance. I agree, it's a good idea, we should do it. But if I'm being honest it's full of pitfalls. There would be ways to make it so, but keep people on the hook that don't take it seriously. Maintain a grade average, or you pay. Stay in school and graduate with a degree, or you pay. Win-win. 

I also think the inability applies to liberals as well, at least those way far left. The extremes of either leaning are equally as bad in their views and inability to compromise. "
1626,"You are cherry picking the data if you are referencing the same study I saw- 

Because they also found that this happens because conservatives process most of their decisions based off of fear. You aren’t talking about vigilance, you’re talking about knee-jerk reactionism.

That's a hell of a case of false equivalence. Do the conference and Trump wins, don't do it and Clinton does. Do the conference and the fate of the republic is in jeopardy, don't and we trod along. Do the conference and seriously risk the continued existence of the human race through nuclear war and climate change, or don't do it and have smart leaders and continued steps towards climate remediation.

1634,"Honest question: Public schools give education for 12 years what’s the difference with just extending that to 16 years but making the last 4 optional? 

Forcing everyone to pay their own way for 4 years to get what is now pretty much considered a minimum requirement seems off. All the big name schools would still keep their prestige and would be able to get public money (like most do now anyway) and the student would pay their way through those schools curriculum. 

What pitfalls do you see in that? Again this is an honest question. 

Everyone regardless of money would be able to at least have a relatively good starting point after public college. Right now the students in poor neighborhoods don’t have much of an opportunity to go to college and not everyone has the same level of parenting to keep them having good grades and provide the forethought to plan for college. Those kids are getting a raw deal I think. I was lucky enough to have good parenting but I know quite a few kids (now adults) who realized too late 11th or 12th grade that they kinda fucked themselves when they were goofing off because their poor parents couldn’t watch them and force them to do their homework. IDK man but i feel like once you become an adult in this world we shouldn’t just shrug our shoulders and say well you shouldn’t have been an idiot at the age of 10-15. "
1635,With such a baller nickname everyone should call him that.
1636,"Bit of hyperbole there.  You've also left out the ""Don't reopen the investigation and risk your career and the reputation of the FBI as a fair, impartial and transparent organization"" bit, which you might not care too much about but the director of the FBI certainly cared about that a lot."
1637,"That's not what I said. Comey's obligations could be interpreted many ways. He should have interpreted them, within the realm of legality, to do good. That means that he should have pushed for greater exposure of Trump, while not doing that horrible press conference that brought Clinton's emails back into the limelight so close to the election. 

It was not 'principle' that had Comey call a press conference within two weeks of the election to announce the reopening of the Clinton investigation."
1638,"Not a bad idea, really.

I see one pitfall being different colleges can specialize in different areas where general schools don't. For example, the university I attended specialized in law and communications and didn't have science labs, etc. Interestingly though and kind of counter to my point, I went there instead of the art institute that was right next door because my teachers were the same ones that taught at the institute - but the university was like 1/10th the cost. I got the same teachers and same classes - but much cheaper and with a bonus of business/management/etc that the art institute didn't teach. So, I suppose you can be *too* specialized.

I think the biggest downfall of having something like a general school and a general degree just pumped out en masse is lowering the value of the degree. ""You have to have a GED to get anywhere!"" Well, most people do so it became ""You have to have a college education!"" Well, that became common so it became ""You have to have a Masters! or Doctorate!"""
1639,"He didn't even have to not reopen the investigation -- he could have reopened it without calling the press conference. That would not have risked his or the FBI's reputation. Not that either is as important as keeping an ignorant madman from lying and cheating his way into power with help of one of America's rivals.

I don't think there's any hyperbole here. I hope America and the world survives Trump intact, but I'm far from certain that will be the case."

1708,"Excise taxes(soda tax) are really popular among left leaning public finance/policy circles. The reason for this is excise taxes, such as taxes on gasoline, smoking, and sugar, are a method of reducing negative externalities that cause damage on society that aren't internalized by natural market forces. Essentially sugary drinks cause damage in a way that isn't accounted for because they are so cheap and if we were to actually express that damage in monetary terms the true price of these products would be closer to the price that this tax expresses than the normal price we normally pay. Normally, we like to leave things up to market forces to create an efficient price for products, but when these products cause external harm/benefits to society that the market can't account for it creates a dead weight loss, i.e. a loss in social efficiency. The entire point of subsidies/excise taxing is to internalize these externalities to maximize social benefit."

1711,"I see what you are getting at, but taxes like this are regressive and evidence concluded this. 

While noble that the idea is to reduce the intake, the tax is an immediate hit. $.30 to lower incomes adds up quicker than upper incomes. I respect that you know this, but I needed to fully detail it. 

It is the same as cigarettes in my opinion. While they are taxed, they are still purchased, and by mostly lower incomes. The numbers have dropped, but mostly through attrition. In the meantime, the lower incomes suffer the tax. 
"
1712,"I understand what you're saying I believe.  That old habits die hard and taxing something doesn't teach people that it's wrong, it just punishes them for their ignorance.  But you can't say that cigarette use has fallen off due to attrition. It has fallen off due to heavy taxes and PSAs about its risks and effects. Attrition doesn't cure addictions.

  In that regard I do agree with you. A simple tax isn't enough, it must be coupled with targeted PSAs and other forms of education on the effects of sugar addiction.  But citing the effect on the tobacco industry, it does work."

2186,"I like your analogy and it's making me think. I'm with you — none of what's said in this book seems outlandish (I mean, within context). I believe these people are capable of saying these things and that the general picture is accurate. 

I'm just extra sensitive to issues of communication now. The right won by dismantling the frameworks we use to argue. They turned reasonable debate into such a soup that a mushmouth like trump could look credible. If we want to rebuild a reality where facts and reason hold water, then we need to be pickier than ever about this kind of thing.

Sadly they will still claim it and they will disagree on the facts until the end of time. I'm not sure what we could do to fix the debate really. Once Roy Moore allegations came out and the hard right called it all ""fake"" then that just tells me it won't matter what the facts are to those kinds of people. They were okay with pedophilia even if he did it. It's turned into cult mentality, the ""leader"" is right, everyone against him is wrong, out to get him, etc. The only hope is that reasonable people do go to one side and leave unreasonable people to his side and then hope that the reasonable side is the majority, unfortunately it's waaaaaay too friggin' easy to split the left up, Bernie vs Hillary and all that.

If people broke the law, regardless of side - they need to be punished for it.  We are really shitty at punishing people in positions of power like this (and companies, for that matter).  Future cries for credibility from opposing sides become null and void if we hold each other to different standards.

Turning a blind eye to this stuff benefits no one but the people why may have broken, or did break the laws.  It doesn't help our cause, or anyone else's, and it does nothing more than tarnish our own credibility.

2239,"When they say the Market, they mean Wall Street---Bankers and Billionaires.

When regular people can't feed their families because the private sector prioritizes profits over people, it's not bankers who starve. They just kick back and buy at a discount...that's how the wealthy greatly increased their holdings after 2008 while the rest of America was struggling to find work.

It's summarized pretty well in this clip.

2240,"Yet all our issues are related to government. Just check /r/latestagecapitalism and you'll be hard pressed to find any problems not caused by democracy. 

Democracy requires an informed people to make repeated good decisions, otherwise it devolves into oligarchy. Did we purchase Trump? No, half the country forced the other half to deal with their bullshit. That is decidedly NOT capitalism. 

Have any issues with industries that have little governing? I'm guessing no. Just healthcare, ISPs, big oil, pharma, etc. "
2241,A lot of Americans are finding work right now tho. Also a lot of Americans besides Wall Street have their money in the market and are doing really well right now.  My 401k saw 20% growth last year.  My company is giving out raises to retain talent because so many places are hiring.  What are you doing wrong?
2242,"I don't talk specifics about my finances online, but I'm doing fine. It's not this year I'm worried about although I'll be moving my investments away from the stock market around October, it's about the National debt building and the lack of top earners who make millions and pay less than you or I in taxes.

Before the recent rise, everyone agreed stocks were overvalued, then they started deregulating everything and we saw obvious manipulation of net neutrality comments and other fraud, we're in the buildup phase, ""irrational exuberance.""

The shiller cape index is above 29 for the 4th time in history, the other times being 1929, 2000, and 2008. It'll probably go up a bit more until a national event jump-starts a crisis. Could be national disasters, could be a war, could be an impeachment, could be the lack of an impeachment. 

You're right, right now, this last year has been good for the market, but when it crashes, most folks still don't have the savings to weather the storm but that's the point, Wall Street doesn't care about that. They'll make their bank, just like you are now and when shit hits the fan, they'll use their cash fund to buy up everything at a discount.

If you want a really honest opinion, there was far more evidence damming Bill Clinton than their currently is for Trump as an individual, the entire country knows Bill lied and he got acquitted . I honestly don't think Trump is going to be removed from office, not if Bill's impeachment is any sort of gauge.

For the record, I really like Bill Clinton, my favorite president by a mile. "
2256,"I can't possibly speak for everyone, but we tend not to listen to newspapers run by partisan hacks. As for objectivity, how about this: we open up a simultaneous investigation into the *Trump Foundation*, and feel free to run down any Clinton Foundation conspiracy theories then.

2262,This is in no way true.  There is abundant evidence that Trump has committed obstruction of justice.
2263,"> Bill lied and got acquitted 

What? You do realize that he wasn't on trial for having a consensual affair, right? And what he was on trial for eventually went to settlement. 

Also, that lie got him impeached. Where are you getting this ""he lied and got acquitted"" thing from?"
2264,Being a concerned citizen is hardly an obsession. Some (and I include myself in these ranks) might call it a “civic duty” to hold elected officials accountable. Whataboutism is a bad faith effort to distract from current events.
2265,I don’t see the part where it’s about Trump. Please explain other than it hurts your feelings. 
2266,"There is evidence he may have done, but it will ultimately come down to his reasons for dismissing Comey.  I'm sure Trump's lawyers are going to lean towards an apparent impartiality in the investigational procedure, which although you may not like to hear, there is definitely some evidence for too.

http://www.businessinsider.de/peter-strzok-clinton-emails-trump-russia-investigation-mueller-2017-12?r=UK&IR=T

If Trump's defence (not sure if an s or c is used here), can even put a shred of doubt about the FBI's impartially in this case, it will make it very difficult to impeach him for firing Comey.

And at this point there's at least as much evidence, not even INCLUDING what Mueller knows that's not public, to charge him with obstruction.  See the NYT article from last night for example.  This is inside of a year of Mueller working.  Clinton's charges were a last ditch attempt to pin anything on him after four years of investigation.

And the Strzok accusations are a ridiculous GOP smokescreen.  Mueller removed him from the team when the texts were exposed, and Strzok bad-mouthed politicians on all sides of the aisle.  Having a viewpoint isn't bias... Letting that viewpoint direct your supposedly impartial work is."

Do you think everyone is going to fall in line whenever MAGA finally actually happens in some place other than your dreams and the imagination of an unwell old man?

She lost the election, she isn't running again - and if you click through the ""sources"" used by the Washington Examiner those sources make it clear that the investigations into her are likely being driven by (the grossly unpopular) White House putting pressure on the DOJ. "

In all honesty, this is one of the worst arguements for having the Electoral College. So in your mind, people's votes should count less? Especially when California subsidizes all those red states? Oh and that insult about California being the same as Mexico was amazingly stupid. Some states aren't scared of having people who aren't white in them (*GASP*), and being the fifth largest economy in the world, I'd say we're doing better than whatever shithole you'd want us to emulate."
2285,"If you want to articulate your political position, a simple “Seig Heil” would do. Californians are Americans, no matter how many of them are non-white. Your intolerance however, is quite un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, and Latinos contribute to our society as much as anyone.

Also: 65 million is more than 62 million. Deal with it."

2296,"So, you missed the part where the story here is that these investigations are politically motivated?

Please, come back when there’s actual movement or a story other than the White House pathetically trying to deflect from the controversy surrounding them. 

It’s hilarious seeing you folks crying over how they escape these investigations without being charged time and time again. 

Your beloved president is unpopular. He didn’t win the popular vote and democrats are motivated. Any guess on who is running against him is pure speculation at this point (when has anyone ever known prior to midterms)... "
2297,"> overlook her crimes

What crimes? Do you realize what this inquiry is for? It's not an investigation (which has already happened, btw, with nothing to show for it). They're looking to see if there's enough blatant evidence of wrongdoing to even start an investigation.

My guess is rhat they won't. Because if anything had been there, they'd have found it before when they were investigating the foundation as part of one of the many investigations into Clinton that have gone exactly nowhere.

Thanks for playing. Try to be a productive member of society. I promise it doesn't hurt."

The swamp needs to be drained. Clinton is part of it. There are more evidence coming out thanks to the Witch Hunt Russia Collusion investigation that you all wanted. Hahahahahaaaa. All the corruption actually points to the Dems!  It’s ironic and super hilarious. 

And I find it funny how Trump is actually showing everyone (GOP and Dems) how to lead. The doormat Obama Era politics is no more. We will no longer provide support to other nations who spit on our face.  America will be strong again.

2406,I'm honestly surprised someone hasn't had the stones to off the cocksmoker yet. Maybe 2018 will be better. 
2407,Well played. 
2408,I now understand why Trump eats fast food so much. The fact he's actually afraid of being poisoned is kind of crazy but I hope he stops for that same reason. Dying of a heart attack will not be as enjoyable and seeing him sad that he can't tweet from prison. 
2409,Nice.

So was Nunes there? Or Ryan called him from his office on speaker with Rosenstein and Wray in the room? 


Alternatively, Nunes is just entirely full of shit and this statement is trying to make nice after a warning— he knows no one present will contradict him publicly anyway, he could say almost anything. . .I’m just remembering all the other times that pesky *Midnight Riding Nunes’s* public statements were total bullshit.

That other [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7ny4ec/rosenstein_meeting_with_paul_ryan_about_russia/) had THOUSANDS of comments saying Nunes was going to get indicted or removed from the HIC.  You mean all the quacks on /r/politics were wrong?"
2418,FUCK Nunes he really is trying to fuck up everything.
2419,"Honestly, good. They are being intentionally dumb certain things acting like it was someone in the Clinton campaign who wrote the Dossier. Have it spelled out in public that Free Beacon commissioned a report by a third party agency that contacted a former Mi6 agent who started writing it, and then later picked up by Clinton's campaign. Trying to shred the legitimacy of the FBI is one thing, but if they go after the Intelligence Agency of a friendly foreign ally, that would be completely off the wall insane. It would result in every international power vivisecting the Trump administration with intel Mueller probably doesn't even have. "

Occam's Razor dude. DAG Rosenstein called Nunes after the meeting probably. But sure, yeah, maybe they conferenced him in.

Rosenstein could easily contradict him if what he's saying isn't true. It's not classified. Chill out for a hot minute and let's wait for the details and conditions of this agreement to come to light."
2425,He was just cleared in an ethics investigation.

2486,"That would be America. Not that it was apparent how full of it this guy is, now he's trying to sell some idea that this country is all about flag worship."

2488,"so why don't you stop doing shit that justifies human beings to burn our flag?

Second of all, the fact that you said Alexandria-Manassas area leads me to believe you are talking out your ass because Alexandria is inside the beltway on the Potomac right across from DC and Manassas is 50 miles away from there.  Everything in between City of Alexandria and Manassas is basically Fairfax county which is one of the safest and wealthiest counties in the entire country.  Sure, if you go digging really deep into Herndon or maybe Arlandria you might be able to find some dudes that are MS-13 but you would have to know where to look and would have to go out of your way to find and interact with them.  They aren't going around terrorizing people that have nothing to do with them...like I said, 90% of Northern Virginia wouldn't even know they exist if nobody told them."

Alexandria isn't St. Louis or Baltimore or even DC...people getting murdered is quite rare and is major news as a result.  Again, I actually lived there for years up until 6 months ago.  I was aware when people got murdered.  There really just isn't an MS-13 presence in Alexandria.  Again, like I said...maybe drive out to Herndon to very specific neighborhoods and I would be willing to give you that you could find trouble if you went *looking* for it.

> I thought it was obvious from the hyphen that i meant I worked in both of those areas, not that they are side-by-side.

...it wasn't...because you said ""the Alexandria-Manassas area"" and that isn't an area that exists...there is an entire whole county in between them.  That isn't how hyphens are used.  That is how you might say the Alexandria-Arlington area because they are next to each other and share much in common and people that live in one tend to spend time in the other as well.  Most people in Alexandria don't spend time in Manassas and vice versa.  Hell, at the wrong time of day just getting between them can take an eternity.  Perhaps saying ""the Alexandria and Manassas areas"" would have been more clear.  I'd still argue you are completely wrong about City of Alexandria and that my years of living there trumps your ""I did some work there"" expertise.

Nothing you have said in any way implies that Northern Virginia residents who aren't interacting with MS-13 are being threatened or have anything to be worried about.  Most of the articles in your link aren't even specifically about Northern Virginia (references to Boston, New York, Maryland) as well as spanning multiple years.  

I never denied they exist or commit crimes or are violent shitheads...I said that it isn't some massive threat like people seem to make it out to be.  You aren't going to turn down the wrong street in Fairfax/Alexandria/Centreville/Chantilly and yes even Manassas and get attacked by MS-13.  You aren't going to have to call a cab at night in Old Town because MS-13 is going to kill you.  It is nonsense.  In northern virginia you have to go looking for gang trouble because it just isn't a part of the overall culture.  This isn't the south side of Chicago..."

Unless you meant they were center-left in American politics, rather than global, which is true.

Which is the OP's point, they took a center party and used their propaganda to shift the overton window so D's went slightly more right and now a center-right party.

In the country where Fox News reigns they're seen as ""center-left to commies"". In countries where Fox News doesn't rule, they're seen as center-right. There's a reason for that, and the reason is OP's point.

See, even idiots who don't watch Fox News fall for this shit, suddenly believing any moderate or even moderate-right position is ""liberal"" because they allow Fox News to frame where the right is, and thus everyone to the left.

We're at a point where ""Admitting global warming is real"" is defacto liberal. It is not, but when you allow Fox News propaganda to set the tone, suddenly now ""I admit CC is real, I am a leftist"" gets implied, even though it's a god damn normal conservative position, just not an insane-fucked-in-the-head-one.

Also like the ""Not going after Pot users"". Firstly, lots of moderates are anti-prohibition. Secondly, like, yeah, Bush was cracking down hard there, amirite?. He could have worked on, you know, doing something actually left leaning (leaning, at best) like declassify it from Sched 1 to 2, but he didn't even do that. But hey, if ""Basically keep on with Bush's federal pot policy"" is an example of liberal actions well... *(Fox News and Sessions convinced you that having pot as Sched 1 drug as a federal policy is now leftist)*

*You're a moron responding to guy pointing out overton window is shifting because of propaganda unintentionally proves OP's point by being so absorbed in propaganda every centrist idea Obama enacts he believes in far-left, simply because he didn't do what Trump is doing.*

Anyhow, did you have any more of those ""left leaning"" examples? Or should I just look at article headlines of what Trump is doing and add ""Obama didn't do that!"" to save you the effort?
"
2722,"Sounds reasonable. I was under the impression that both Obama and HRClinton are much more friendly to corporations and also more hawkish than Corbyn, Sanders or Trudeau, and that's why I would put them more towards the center than the latter ones, but we'd have to look at the details to decide that."
2723,"From August of last year, old news."

2726,And Grassley is full of shit.
2727,Fuck off 
2728,"Your time is almost at an end, Grassley. Use it wisely."
2729,"Remember that time when Trump gave classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador and their press in the oval office — alone, with the US press barred — only days after he fired Comey?  And boasted about how it relieved a lot of pressure on him?  

Seems like something the Judiciary chairman would be demanding answers on.  Oh, he's just demanding answers on Comey months after the memos were released with no real new information coming out about them?  Inexplicable.  Unless...."
2730,Grassley is a big ole Equus asinus ass. 
2731,"There was nothing classified in the memo Comey sent to Richman, that's a bald-faced lie. You're a traitorous, disgraceful cur Grassley. "
2732,"Good Christ, it is so blatantly transparent that Grassley took Russian money that it's disgusting. When he dies, I hope he's buried upside down and the Earth salted where his traitorous body lies, so everyone can easily find it to piss upon it."

2735,"Grassley may be alarmed to find out that many academics (and others in private industry) hold Federal Security Clearances, some possibly higher than his...

I have a basic one, I can ship biological packages on commercial aircraft without invasive TSA searches.  There's a fuck-ton of actual papers involved (6-8 documents some of which are 3-5 piece forms) and another shit load of verification and codes, but it's my name on the bottom line. "
2736,"Grassley really is appalling. One of the worst senators to be honest. He doesn't want to give tax cuts to people who will spend it on ""booze, women and movies"", threatens to end blue slips to push Trump nominees through, makes up conspiracies to protect Trump and pretends to be a man of honor. People show him respect because he's old. He may as well rot.  "
2737,Guess who had the legal right to define whether or not a memo was classified?
2738,"Retroactively marked as classified? Heard this before.

FOUR of the SEVEN total memos he created.

As it turns out, FOUR of the SEVEN memos he created were classified.

Therefore, at least ONE of the FOUR memos sent to Richman must have been classified."
2746,"Not Comey, who was unemployed at the time."
2747,"This is absolutely and demonstrably false.

2755,"All of this as awful presumptuous. Read grassleys own line of questioning. The issue is *when* those memos were classified. 

They're not classified right when they're created, so it's more than possible that comey wrote those memos, shared them with his friend, and they later became classified when they became a part of the investigation. 

In fact, that's definitely the most likely scenario. The memos likely never would have been classified if they hadn't been shared with his friend because they never would've become part of the investigation. 

You're misunderstanding how these things work"
2756,Fuck off
2757,"I dunno, were there? Did he? Do you know? If not then isn't this just baseless speculation? Is there any proof of what you are claiming?"
2758,"No you're absolutely right on that.  I meant more, he should be demanding answers on Comey's firing.  Plus it's got the added angle of some shady handling of classified information, albeit it 'legal'.  It's a matter of priorities.  Comey leaking classified information, even if true, was in the interest of the public good, so seems a strange thing to pursue instead of what the memos were about."
2759,Comey did not have the ability to leak his own memos of which weren't classified? You people are a hoot.
2760,Maybe he tweeted out the proof?
2761,"The FBI, Comey, and Richman.

Those are the sources.

Did you even bother reading the article?"
2762,"You are the one misunderstanding how these things work.

The memos contained classified information when they were created.

Full stop."
2763,"Those memos were government property, and according to the FBI - the majority of them were classified."
2764,"Ummmm do you care to cite a source on that?

Are they classified because they contained descriptions of classified material, or are they classified because they later became a part of an ongoing national security investigation surrounding Trump? 

Considering these are the very questions that grassley wants answered, I'd be very impressed if you had a source to back up claims that not even a sitting US Senator would make. 

Furthermore, none of this absolves trump of any wrong doing. He doesn't get off on money laundering and conspiracy charges because just because comey leaked info, which it is not even clear that he did. "
2765,"Last things first - I never said this exonerated Trump in any way of any potential wrongdoing.  I didn't even imply that it does.  This is not a zero sum game, if Trump is guilty of breaking the law then I want to know about it and I am willing to have my opinion of him changed.  As it stands, there has been zero evidence that he is, and all of the claims have turned out to be overwrought and undersourced.

More to the point... read the actual article, and follow the sources included.  I will post a portion of it here for clarity.

>Grassley, R-Iowa, penned a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein late Wednesday, saying he and his staff had reviewed the Comey memos which were “created purportedly memorializing his interactions with President Trump.” They did so in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) at the FBI and the Senate, because **the FBI deemed the “majority of the memos” to be “classified.”**

>""Of the seven memos, four are marked classified at the 'SECRET'or 'CONFIDENTIAL' levels,"" Grassley wrote, adding that ""only three did not contain classified information.”


>Grassley’s letter appears to back up July 2017 reports that several of Comey’s private memos contained classified material. The Hill first reported this development; Fox News confirmed with a legal source at the time that some material contained classified information. The president seized on those reports at the time with a tweet saying: “That is so illegal!” 

>**Comey admitted in congressional testimony in June 2017 that he had given his friend, Columbia University Professor Daniel Richman, his memos about discussions with Trump in order to have his notes leaked** to The New York Times -- hoping to spur the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.

>**Richman told Fox News in July that he indeed received four memos** from Comey, but said none of them were marked classified."
2766,"Are you having trouble understanding what I said in the last post? 

*Why are they classified and when where they classified is the question.*

Did comey describe classified material in the memos, and that's why they are classified? 

Or were the memos classified later because they became part of an ongoing national security investigation? 

The first scenario would be illegal, the second would not. Do you understand now? 

If comey simply described his interactions with trump, did not describe anything classified in the memos, gave them to his friend and the FBI as well, and then the FBI deemed that they would be classified not because they contained classified info, but because of the role they'll play in the ongoing investigation of trump, then that is not illegal; they weren't classified when he shared them and they didn't contain any info that was classified. "
2767,"Why is it you people always have to try to add some smug comment into your responses.  It really isn't clever and doesn't help your reasoning. 

Anyway...

My contention is that the second situation is not possible.   The government doesn't take public information and classify it to the level of requiring a SCIF just because it's being used in an investigation.   

That doesn't make any logical sense.  Why would they do that, and how would they control information that was not classified and was already public knowledge?

Furthermore - any documents created on a government laptop with classified protocol are born classified.  Technically all 7 memos would have been classified when they were written, and at some point 3 of them were declassified when the FBI reviewed them before sending them to Congress.

Even if that were not the case...  all conversations between the President and the FBI Director are classified, because the President has the capability of claiming Executive Privilege on any such communications.  In fact, this truth was widely used during the Obama administration to prevent Congress from learning about conversations President Obama may or may not have had with seniors such as Holder, Lynch, and Comey."
2768,"Lies? you mean where he reported exactly what he was told? uhuh. Someone is trying to deflect. If they were actually lies, they would've went through with the cease and desist, instead of just threatening one.

Now why would they threaten a cease and desist and not go through with it unless they didn't want something to be verified or discovered during an investigation and eventually leaked to the public? "
2769,"All he admitted was that he is reporting on what multiple people with a history of lying have told him. Obviously, that is going to mean that at least some of the stories are fabrications...since they were told to him by people who make a living being complete liars.

That is completely different than him saying he made shit up and lied."
2770,No.  It really doesn't.
2771,"Sure, *he's* the one in legal jeopardy."
2772,"Trumpian logic...

Lie to everyone. Then when they quote you just say they are telling lies and should go to jail!!!"
2773,Then sue.  Unless discovery would be a problem of some kind?
2774,"He admits that he wrote _others_ lies, not that he lied. There's a difference there.

Also, he prefaces the book, from what I've read, by telling the readers this, settings expectations that this book should not be taken 100% factually, as it will be a mixture of the lies he was told and what he could verify/what he personally experienced.

The fact that media are reporting on it so uncritically at times is the scarier part to me - they're the ones who should be reminding folks that this book should not be taken as 100% truth and that it's intent is in part to put readers ""in"" the White House - never knowing if what they're reading is the truth as he's drilled it down, or whether it's a lie that he's been told by someone completely detached from reality who may believe what they're saying, but is still ultimately lying."
2775,I look forward to the lawsuit. I'm sure it will be entertaining as hell. 
2776,yeah sure. 
2777,Haha nice try. This book was vetted out the wazoo by the publisher's attorneys. There's no chance they're in legal jeopardy.
2778,"Setting it up by saying the lying liars in the White House couldn't keep their stories straight, and then outlining the lies he was told, contradictions and all, is hardly fiction. It illustrates the fiction that exists in the White House. And exposing the liars isn't the same as telling a lie. This story is just feeble spin, and I do mean feeble, to discredit the book, and Wolff. The disfunction in the White House is on display every single day. It's hardly a revelation. "
2779,"There's a ""Crazy Cases"" and ""Sports Law"" section on this website, so I'm not inclined to think they're super credible."
2780,"Hahaha.

This is the blog that used to be called LawNewz.

I see they changed their name, but still couldn't find any competent lawyers to write for them."
2781,"FAKE NEWS.

Wolff did not admit to lying. Wolff simply stated that he could not corroborate some of what he was told. He **literally quoted people, and in context.** You wouldnt even have this if he didnt have the integrity to admit it up front. 

Get this fake shit outta here."
2782,"""Trumpian lies"" apparently is what Republicans are all about. This ""crime"" zine is obviously a Republican e-propaganda organ. 

Read the article about the book closely and see even a bigger lie being promoted here. "
2783,"Wow. This is dumber than dumb.

I'm listening to the book right now, and I get a bit frustrated that it is a narrative without explicit sources, but it is what it is. If only on-record sources had been included it would have been a two-page book.

As for ""lies"", not every contradicting account is even close to being defamation. Saying that Bannon was bad at answering e-mails etc isn't defamation even if it is a deliberate lie.

Furthermore, most of this is about perspectives and biases, not lies. Five different people who witness the same car crash will give different accounts of it depending on where they stand and if they are personally involved. And they all may tell the truth as they perceive it. "
2784,"He never said he lied, wtf."
2785,"This, plus if they can dig up him saying he wanted to ruin Trump with this book could be the rare instance of a libel suit by a public figure winning. "
2786,"no matter how much you hate the president, you should make sure that everything is true."
2787,I hope we get to hear all the unexpurgated recordings Wolff claims to have. Lordy. 
2788,"I want to remind people of this every time a conservative threatens legal action. 

Its funny how they never actually go to court, like there is something stopping them. I wish we could *discover* what it is..."
2789,"The opening forward tells you right off the bat that he overheard people lying and then their clarifications on them as off the record things, became public on the record things. 

Great book. "
2790,I’d be more skeptical of the contents of the book if Trump hadn’t immediately tried to prevent its release. That action alone makes it seem more credible. 
2791,I’ve read a lot of the book already no where does he say this. Keep carrying water for them why don’t you. 
2792,*It says here that Sloppy Steve called me an idiot.  He actually called me a moron.  Fake News.*
2793,"hahaha, i was wondering why i haven't seen any post from them in a while, at first i though it was satire, nice to see some things never change."
2794,"Without writing that he had an absolute defense against libel claims by saying ""I thought I was passing on true information."" He lost that defense by admitting he believed some of the information was false and yet still published it. "
2795,"yes, that's why trump and his supporters should be sure they are telling the truth when they are backstabbing each other to a journo for revenge. Lies are on them he's just reporting what they told him."
2796,"You mean the man who 'saved coal' should never ever lie? The man who had the 'largest ever turn out for an inauguration period' should be held to the truth?

POTUS 45 is a lying sack of shit and *that* is incontrovertible fact. "
2797,Hey remember when Hannity repeatedly lied about Seth Rich?
2798,Does he give us the same courtesy? Or does he just lie all the time about the pettiest and most important things with equal abandon? 
2799,"Thats exactly what wolff did. That's why everyone admits his book is 100% accurate. He exposed the liars for who they are and showed that even donald's closest allies think he is a pathetic loser.

The trump train derailed.  Thank you Wolff."
2800,hahaha
2801,That is why Trump need to stop trying to obstruct the ongoing investigation on the Trump-Russian conspiracy. 
2802,"Okay, so why doesnt Trump go infront of the Senate and testify under oath and tell us what really happened?"
2803,"That's why the book is so damning and interesting. Because of it's provable facts. Oh lordy, there are tapes."
2804,"Oh, I totally agree. But that's not an excuse for the way media have been lionizing Wolff over this book rather than rightfully looking at his book very skeptically. Wolff himself, in interviews, has been pretty open about how the book should not be taken as total truth.

Don't get me wrong, Trump's batshit crazy, as are those around him that are protecting him, and much of the book seems downright reasonable for him. And as you say, the fact that he responded so strongly is a possible indication of truth - though with Trump it's also a strong indication that he reacts this way to _anything_ remotely negative about him regardless of whether it's true or not, being a deep seated narcissist and all."
2805,"Can you actually read? The article itself says the prologue contains the following:

>Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue. These conflicts, and that looseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book.

>Sometimes I have let the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge them. In other instances I have, through a consistency in the accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true."
2806,It is literally the entire point of the author's note that behind the book.
2807,Remember when he said he would get waterboarded to raise money for charity?

Zinke is a  looter who wants to give away our national parks and monuments to his pals in the oil and mining industries - not to mention all the money he's embezzled from the Treasury to pay for private jet and helicopter flights.

From an interview with Donna Carpenter (Jake Burton's wife and current CEO of Burton):

**espnW:** Burton had a close connection to Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Until recently, his stepson, Dave, was your global team director. How involved were your employees in the election?

**DC:** We had more than two dozen employees volunteering for Bernie's campaign, including my vice president of human resources. The election was devastating. I can't guarantee you there are no Trump supporters here at Burton, but as a whole, Bernie and the Democratic Party in Vermont really reflect Burton values and the values of Vermont.

Judging by Trump’s totally subservient attitude towards Putin, my guess is that Trump entered into a conspiracy to get help from Russia (e.g. Russia will illegally hack and use Clinton’s emails for maximum benefit for Trump) but there’s likely other elements. The Trump family used to brag about money from Russia, and we know about money laundering with Russian oligarchs, like the 2008 mansion transaction. Most likely, Trump was a failed business man who depended heavily on Russian money laundering to keep up his lifestyle, and when he got an offer of help from Putin, the offer came with carrots and sticks. The carrots are that Putin could expose and take down Trump at any time, so as President, Trump has to do what Putin wants the vast majority of the time, except when Trump needs to do something to look independent. Trump is terrified the truth will come out."

3162,"I encourage you to, although I would note that whether they are “brought” or not, in a criminal case, is uncertain as a lot of things can unfold.

For instance, there is some debate as to whether a sitting President can be indicted.

It would not surprise me, as an example, if he were an unindicted co-conspirator and listed as such in Mueller’s eventual report to Congress. Whether Congress acts on that is a political consideration and hardly an accurate accounting of facts. Even if we assume they would act on it and impeach him, it’s possible that his successor could pardon him before he ever saw a day in court. Lots of ways for this to play out, even if he’s guilty of the worst of those crimes, without charges being brought against him.

Because of the complicated nature of investigations and trials of Presidents, however, the question of whether charges are officially brought against him is in some ways irrelevant as to whether he engaged in any of those behaviors. More to the point, and as a point of fact, we have already seen a few of these charges (along with obstruction-relevant charges like 1001 lying to the FBI) brought against aides and campaign officials. And we’ve seen a metric fuckton of evidence that other campaign members were engaged in collusive behavior with Russian officials and cutouts, and engaged in a conspiracy to cover up those activities. Where that legal exposure eventually lands? Hard to say without knowing what Mueller is up to.

What’s not hard to say is that, from a non-criminal perspective, we’ve seen enough behavior from him and his people to make a public electoral judgment about his unfitness for office, his inability/unwillingness to faithfully execute the law, and his *severe* lack in qualification to be a steward of our institutions.

Yeah, it’s pretty fucking hard to say no crimes were committed because they were.

And Russia obviously had an influence on the election. How to measure what that influence was is difficult, but it’s impossible that they had no influence. Releasing the hacked emails colored entire portions of debates; it was the subject of the news coverage every single day; it kept the “BUT HER EMAILS” banter alive for months and made Comey’s late announcement carry more weight. It’s like introducing a new species into an ecosystem; its effects may be hard to measure and can certainly be hard to predict, but it always has an effect.

3224,"I agree the governorship is less partisan, but only to a degree. For example, until 2005 Louisiana had a solid history of only electing Democratic senators, and they had one democrat until 2015. Additionally, John Bel Edwards only won the governorship because his opponent was marred by a sex scandal. 

Also, Montana had 2 democratic senators until 2014, and still has one. I don't think those two states are evidence to back up your claim; I think they're just weird / have flukes. "

So the discussion has jumped from one reporters view ""centrist"" to ""half way between"" X  and Y.

I don't like pointing out that the term ""neo-liberal"" is completely free floating now.

I have to bring up the fact that there is a subreddit called /r/neoliberal.  And I'm not one.  They worship the idea of Paul Krugman being one, but the reality is they are not like Paul Krugman.

The best use of neo-liberal IS in describing a subsection of the Chicago School of economics inhabited by one of Milton Friedman's evil sub-personalities.  

The third major use of it is a kind of ""mocking"" - that is it isn't something someone agrees they are.  Conservatives mock neo-liberal as too liberal.  People who think they are progressives mock it for a different reason and NEITHER accurately describe anything or anyone who calls themselves ""neoliberal.:

As such it's just an inflammatory word used much as ""centrist"" is - to poison.


There are some terrible things that the Clinton administration did and there are some very good things one aspects appear in the article, though I feel we always miss one of the most important points - taking care of our young people: higher education and vocational training WITHOUT causing them enormous debt.

The US has strained at competitive advantage in the years since Grover Norquist became the Republican god.  And the reason is - because our kids have been forced into debt. 

NO OTHER COUNTRY DOES THAT!  That I know of at least.

Just the decision for America to be competitive again is a MAJOR MAJOR difference from what we have now.  

A writer this morning referred to this as not social justice, but opportunity.  The real problem in not providing for our young is that it hurts the US economy.  From the point of view of the wealthy - it hurts them as well.

I see reason if great importance  but lacking, for instance, in the way the press has become accustomed to writing headlines.   The headlines are too often too weak or too strong.  Rarely do I see an inviting headline similar to ""Democrat criticizes  Trump.""  Instead it has to be ""Tapper SLAMS Trump.""  Well no conservative is going ot read that article.  Where as if it simply said ""Tapper critical of Trump"" then they want to know why and they'll read it.

So I can agree.    I heard a program earlier today where the speaker used the term ""opportunity"" - it was a completely different issue from what is in the article.

He and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think Nixon was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response.""

* ""I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war.

3335,Yeah I liked when he phone banked for Trump after his father was called a killer and his wife called ugly.
3336,Spotted the democrat. 
3337,"It did. The polling averages predicted Hillary would win the popular vote by about 3 points, plus or minus 3. She won the national popular vote by 2 points, well within the margin of error. Media coverage often treated polls as a prediction of the electoral college instead of the popular vote while ignoring the margin of error, but you can't really blame a private business for knowing that most people don't understand statistics and designing their product accordingly. If the customer base had the attention span to listen to a detailed analysis of the numbers, they wouldn't be saying things like ""Because polling went sooooooo well in 2016"" after having over a year to understand the first five minutes of Statistics 101."

3345,Unfortunately they’re content running our state government for now. 
3346,"Yes, but none of them want to be involved in politics."
3347,I'm pretty sure Ted Cruz is going to win and also that this sub will downvote any thread that doesn't show him losing only to end up shocked when he wins. Similar to how they only upvoted pro Bernie news and Polls in 2016.
3348,"at first I was like ""awww, not Rigel, its one of my favorite stars"", but then I was like ""fuck it, it's almost at the end of its life cycle anyways...and nobody gives a shit about that backwards planet""...so, I've made my peace with it."

3351,"Medicare and Medicaid aren't free. I don't care about every individual person's problems, that's entitled feel good bullshit. I care about the real, long term threats facing our country, and I'll be honest, neither party is addressing them. Spending is out of control, Dems raise spending and get stonewalled from raising taxes, and Republicans lower taxes and get stonewalled from lowing spending. All that shit you named that gets paid for with taxes, it's not free, and guess what happens if interest becomes too much of a burden. Yea, that's right, they cease to exist, and no one is going to be getting 'saved'. That's the direction we are heading, as boomers retire, the biggest contributors to Social Security will be the biggest drain. None of this money was saved for future generations, as the government borrowed the surplus to fund spending elsewhere. All those programs won't exist in your future at the rate we are going.

It sucks because my favorite politician is a Dem, and she stands no chance of becoming president because they are doing the same thing to her as they did to Bernie, despite the fact that if they did she would be even more electable than Bernie. So no, I will not support that party ever unless they stop the bullshit they are doing and give America what they need, not some handouts for votes while they give their donors everything else."
3352,"He's less of one, at least he's opposed fellow Republicans more than Beto has Dems. Regardless, he would have to be Roy Moore for me to support Beto over him. As I said, with the crimes the Democratic party did in screwing over their more honest candidate for Hillary Clinton, I won't support them and hope they crash and burn. I'd rather see them actually change, but if they haven't learned their lesson they never will. Instead they've just explored new ways to shove the same shit down our throat."
3353,That would defeat the purpose of an internal poll. These usually aren’t released as it helps the opposition.

2) Two presidents in less than 20 years who are elected in spite of the Popular vote, one with a legal ruling by the SCOTUS.

3) Dictating major overhauls of the Mililtary's admissions policy and essentially firing thousands of servicepeople unilaterally and without warning through twitter.

3417,"I like Oprah just fine. But the President is a role that should be filled by someone who is qualified, not just a personality. She might say great things, be smart, and have progressive views, but that doesn't make her qualified for the position. The POTUS should be a seasoned diplomat, knows the rule of law inside and out, and be able to negotiate based on what is best for the nation. Voting for popular personalities with ideological views is not the right course for our nation. "

We would all wince if a pop figure argued that their fame meant they could also do the work of an experienced machinist or a medical doctor.

Unless you have redefined celebrity to mean ""hollywood actors and/or actresses"".

I'm tired of the traditional ""went to law school then used mommy and daddy's money to springboard into politics"" types and I can think of very few ""traditional"" politicians who would be a better leader than a minority woman who was born to a single impoverished mother, who weathered a childhood of sexual abuse and neglect, and who grew up to command a billion-dollar business empire and become one of the most charitable individuals in the entire country.

""College radicals turned mainstream"" are even worse than ""mommy and daddy's money"" lawyers.

Hell, Tommy fucking Wiseau probably understands what it means to be an American more than every single person who has graduated with a poly-sci or law degree combined and would do as good a job as our current and likely future choices for president.

see: Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Oprah"
3430,"I'm really on-the-fence about it. At this point, I feel like ANYONE is a step up from Trump. But I also feel like we shouldn't be setting the bar that incredibly low. I would 100% prefer an actual Democratic candidate. But ideally they'll have to find someone without any of the ""establishment"" baggage. There's a lot of qualified Democratic public servant candidates like Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Karmala Harris, Cory Booker, etc... (I'm just naming likely candidates not saying each of those names would win or is ""better"" than others). 

But, some of the underlying issues that caused Trump to win in 2016 haven't gotten better, they've gotten worse. Trump was the brick thrown through the window of Politics to try to wake up our elected representatives whom most didn't seem to feel really represented them. We could argue that Trump was not the change we were looking for, but I think for a not-tiny part of the electorate we were just mad.

If Oprah comes off as authentic, she might have a good chance at bringing in some interesting demographics. Women and minorities might show up for Oprah more than anyone else, and this would be on the heels of maybe some #metoo movement tailwinds. 

I'd be more interested in whether or not Oprah took it seriously. She would need to bring in advisers and a cabinet who knows what they're doing, divest herself of her businesses, and put out a few policy positions that we could all rally behind. 

I mean, Zuckerberg vs Oprah for 2020? What has happened to us?"
3431,"The PEOPLE don't want ""experienced"" people in politics given the fact all someone has to do is harp on the fact they aren't a politician and they automatically win the rural idiot vote."
3432,"I don't think it's intentional, they seem to have their heart in the right place. But I agree that they can't really understand the daily life of the working class simply because they haven't had to live it firsthand for such a long time (and in many cases, ever). 

Elon Musk perhaps though. He was very severely abused, and I don't think you ever forget that. "
3433,A billionaire will NEVER be an honest champion for the working class.  
3434,You've got a good point there.
3435,"that may be true, but that doesn't mean they can't champion something foreign or long forgotten to them.

If that's the case, then you would have to apply that logic to all situations. only former homeless can champion the homeless, former foster children, abuse victims, refugees, etc. 

"
3436,"I'm not saying I'm in favor of Oprah running, but in fairness, she grew up poor and enduring terrible abuse that resulted in her giving birth at 14 to a premature baby boy that died.

I don't think all the money in the world makes a person forget stuff like that."
3437,"Elon Musk isn't eligible to be President, though."
3438,"Ah true, I did not know this about her. "
3439,It's the same problem as the pedophiles in the catholic church... there are simply too many of them and they keep protecting each other.

Also, aren't conservatives always the ones going on about how increasing minimum wage will just mean the increased cost will be passed to consumers? How is that **any different** than increasing the costs for landlords? Do they not expect this massive new expense be redirected to the tenants? 

Oh, right--propaganda piece. Townhall. Vilification and financial destruction of education to keep opponents in check.

>Renters came out winners under the new tax law. For over a century, the federal tax code catered to homeowners and treated renters like second-class citizens. Homeowners have been able to deduct interest on their mortgages and home equity loans, as well as property taxes. Meanwhile, everyone, including renters, footed the bill for these deductions by paying higher rates. The new tax law at last begins leveling the playing field between renters and homeowners.

>Millions of New Yorkers and Californians reap the benefits, because these states have among the lowest rates of homeownership in the nation, and renting is common. So ignore the hyperventilating from Democratic politicians that tax reform is a gift to the rich.

>New York Senator Chuck Schumer condemns the new tax law as ""a gut shot to the middle class"" while ""rewarding the wealthiest among us."" Just the opposite is true. Tax reform benefits renters living in urban areas -- a key Democratic constituency.

>Democrats are usually eager to slap taxes on millionaires. But today, they're defending deductions that benefit only the wealthiest homeowners in the country's most expensive East and West Coast enclaves. Places like Westchester County, New York, and Marin County, California.

>Under the new tax law, everyone -- renters and homeowners alike -- will have their tax rates cut and their standard deduction almost doubled. Most will end up paying less tax. To cover the cost of these cuts, the law caps the mortgage deduction for buyers of the priciest real estate. Few homebuyers will even notice it, because they're not borrowing $750,000 or more. Last year, only 4 percent of homebuyers borrowed that much, and only about 100,000 buyers will take out such huge mortgages in 2018.

>It's true that the cap will likely hit the wallets of the bicoastal elite. Some 64 percent of buyers in Manhattan's rarefied real estate market took out a mortgage that big, and 58 percent of San Francisco buyers did.

>But the tax change certainly won't hurt middle class first-time homebuyers. On average, they buy homes with a median price of $182,500. In the past, the tax code encouraged wealthy homeowners to buy even bigger homes and borrow more. Great for the wealthy and the banks. No much help for the average Joe.

>Homeownership isn't any higher than in the late 1960s -- with only 64 percent of households owning their own home. For minorities, the goal is even farther out of reach, with only 46 percent of black families and Hispanic families owning their home. So disregard the partisan claim that lowering the cap on the mortgage interest deduction is going to hurt the middle class.

>The other major deduction for homeowners has been property taxes. The new law puts a $10,000 lid on deducting all state and local taxes combined, whether income, sales, or property taxes. Homeowners in most of the nation don't have much to worry about.

>Hardest hit are a few tony counties with multimillion dollar homes like Westchester County, New York, where the average property tax tab is a whopping $15,000. For that, the streets should be paved with gold.

>But only one-fifth of New York property owners pay over $10,000 and about 30 percent of New Jersey homeowners do.

>Schumer rants against the new tax law, claiming it hurts ""middle-class and working families."" Baloney. Tax reform makes the tax code more progressive, not less. It imposes added costs on the wealthiest homeowners to fund across-the-board tax breaks for all filers. Including renters.

>Homeowners still have the option of taking deductions for most mortgage interest and property taxes, but almost all will crunch the numbers and find it pays to take the nearly doubled standard deduction instead. Only 5 percent of filers are expected to itemize.

>California's Jerry Brown calls the tax law ""evil in the extreme."" That's demagoguery. Most taxpayers will end up with more money in their wallets.

"
3500,"Renters don't get a win, it's just homeowners who get a loss.

A ""win"" for renters would be gaining the ability to deduct rent. In MA for instance you can deduct up to $3000 of rent from your state taxes.

Separately, train yourself to see past the lie-by-omission most frequently repeated in conservative propaganda: the ""doubled"" standard deduction.

Don't believe anyone who tells you you get a good deal in the tax bill because of this. Here's why.

The personal exemption was repealed (would have been $4150 in tax year 2018). That's something *everyone* loses.

The net of exemption & deduction goes from $10650 to $12000 per taxpayer. That's not double - it's a puny gain especially in light of all the other itemized deductions that were ravaged.

Real tax reform for income earners would've made it $18000 instead of $12000.

The first Democrat who figures this out and comes up with a politically viable plan to pay for it (which won't be hard because the majority of the electorate wants the rich to be taxed *more*) will sail into elected office."
3501,"One thing: Grandfather clause.  regarding Interest deduction for mortgages: Only applies to people buying a home in 2018+.  Even then only on homes above $500K. 

I missed it where do renters get an additional deduction?  This article is basically saying that renters made out because they didn't get taxed more and saying they won something is a disingenuous lie."
3502,"The point of the deduction wasn't to 'punish renters'. It was intended to make buying a home easier, because owning a home is much better than renting (in terms of building equity).

Is the child tax deduction unfair to people without kids? I don't think so, I guess this author does though.

I don't really see how capping something that effects 4% of people will pay for the doubling of deductions of 96% of people.

I don't see how making it more expensive for some people to buy a house will increase home ownership rates.

3503,"Pro tip: no one wins, except the wealthy. And only those cuts that help working class Americans expire."
3504,"Renters win because homeowners lose, good argument. As long as someone else is more harmed by the tax bill I guess that makes you sleep better at night. The point of mortgage interest deductions and local property tax deductions was to encourage homeownership. Instead we are moving towards guaranteeing a population of permanent renters. Most people’s homes are their most valuable asset and can often be liquidated later in life to pay for retirement. Now you have a nation where people are going to be permanent renters, most likely with less or no benefits like social security or Medicare to fall back on, and even less retirement benefits from employers. Really setting up nice for everyone. Also, articles like these have to please stop painting middle class blue state people as “elites”. A modest home in NY or CA is often 500k or more with taxes that already exceed the 10k SALT cap being implemented. You’re harming average people with this bill. Stop painting it as though it’s just millionaire homeowners who are negatively impacted."

* To cover the cost of these cuts, the law caps the mortgage deduction for buyers at $750,000 or less (only 4% of home owners). Meaning people with million dollar properties will lose their mortgage deduction and a renter will get a higher standard deduction.

Wow it looks like you've discovered supply side economics has some validity...  
  
So, if you believe the 15$ an hour won't cause inflation in costs and other salaries why do you then believe this will ""trickle down"""
3508,"It's not saying they get an additional deduction, just that the playing field between renting and owning was slightly leveled by capping the mortgage interest deduction.

I'm so torn on this. On the one hand, the mortgage interest deduction is incredibly regressive and is universally despised by economists across the political spectrum. On the other, this new cap seemed to have been done purely as retribution against blue states which is politically dangerous ground to trod."
3509,"> Renters win because homeowners lose, good argument.

No, renters win and people who have less than 750K mortgages win. They all get a double standard deduction, and the homeowners of middle class houses can still deduct mortgage.  
  
The losers are people who own homes in excess of 750K (4% of Americans)....   
  
> The point of mortgage interest deductions and local property tax deductions was to encourage homeownership.  
  
And they are still there for 96% of Americans.   
  
> Most people’s homes are their most valuable asset and can often be liquidated later in life to pay for retirement.  
  
Most people's homes are worth less than 750K and won't be touched by this.  
  
> Also, articles like these have to please stop painting middle class blue state people as “elites”.  A modest home in NY or CA is often 500k
  
I'm sorry even in NY State the number of homes which cost over 750K is a small percent. Outside of places like, Manhattan and San Francisco it's a minority.  Outside of the NYC Metro area it's a tiny minority. 
  
And keep in mind this is the amount owned on the home, not the homes value."
3510,"> and their standard deduction almost doubled

Except everyone loses the personal exemption. It's only about a 13% change for the better, not a 100% change. "
3511,"As a renter, it's hard to be happy about a temporary, small tax cut when corporations are getting huge, permanent ones. "
3512,Costs get passed down to consumers. Benefits don't.
3513,"I'm in the same boat as you, I've never been a big fan of the mortgage interest deduction for a number of reasons, but it should have been eliminated through actual tax reform, not this abomination of a tax bill."
3514,"I think that without the mortgage interest deduction, you would have fewer people owning the homes they have. People count on it when they budget what size housing payments they can afford. The cost of living is also a factor, but it’s also a quality of life issue. This tax program does nothing for renters, it just makes housing less affordable for those living in areas where housing is expensive. It prices folks out, leaving them as renters in areas they can afford. Leaving longer commuting hours, and possibly less options for schooling or daycare. "
3515,"You’re completely ignoring the SALT deduction cap and its impact on property tax in states like NY and CA. Property tax in those states can easily exceed 10k on homes that cost considerably less than 750k. And that’s before you even get to the loss of a homeowner’s state income tax deductions from employment. So you’re punishing those people by no longer allowing them to deduct a large portion, potentially the whole amount, of their property tax. That’s a huge loss for homeowners in those states, and these are middle class homeowners not just millionaires. Repubs and conservatives always talking about unfair double taxation when it comes to estate tax. A tax that impacts a population of less than 1%. But somehow double taxing a much larger population on their SALT doesn’t get afforded the same argument."
3516,"The increase in tax-free income is about 15% for those who are not itemizing, not 100%. Losing the personal exemption wipes away most of the standard deduction increase."
3517,"Doubling your standard deduction is ""small""... Hmmm  
  
For me it means I probably don't pay someone to do my taxes this year, that's another 300$ in my pocket right there to say nothing of the savings on my tax bill.  
  
I'm far from rich and this is going to put about $200 more a month in my pocket."
3518,">I think that without the mortgage interest deduction, you would have fewer people owning the homes they have.

Paradoxically, the MID actually inflates housing prices by encouraging people to get bigger houses than they otherwise could afford and increasing demand for ownership, thus putting ownership out of reach for a lot of young people. It also disincentivizes density which makes housing more scarce which drives up prices, which again favors existing owners.

>People count on it when they budget what size housing payments they can afford.

And they wouldn't count on it if we got rid of it. How is this an argument?

>This tax program does nothing for renters

I mean, it more or less does nothing for renters. Again I'm not defending this article, more opposing the MID.

>those living in areas where housing is expensive

And the MID has contributed to housing being so expensive in those areas. People who are priced out right should be eager for a housing correction.

>It prices folks out, leaving them as renters in areas they can afford. Leaving longer commuting hours, and possibly less options for schooling or daycare.

Again, see point #1. The MID paradoxically raises RE prices."
3519,"The Townhall article ignores this cap for presumably the same reason, which is that it's a much stronger argument against the tax bill.

Pretty much everyone is wrongly hung up on SALT as a blue state issue. And sure, it's easiest to notice it in NY and CA.

But the vast majority of red and purple states have both state/local and property taxes. It's pretty easy to find taxpayers in them who are worse off with the cap on the SALT deduction.

Will the rate cuts et al make up the difference for many of them? Sure.

All of them? Hell no.

It didn't work this way with the Bush tax cuts - 0% of filers got a tax hike. (They were bad tax cuts for other reasons, of course).

Foolishly, Trump and Congress have opened the door for attack ads from Democrats against ""the Republican tax hike""."
3520,"What about the new tax bill means you won't need to pay someone to do your taxes if you had been doing so before? 

I may get 100 a month more. Obviously that is quite a bit of money for me, but let's not pretend like the working class are the ones this bill was for. Otherwise our tax cuts would be permanent and the corporate cuts would be the ones that could expire. "
3521,"Wow, congratulations on your $1800 a year.  You can totally pay off your car, start a business, pay down your school debt or put the 20% down on a new home with that amazing savings.  On second thought, you may want to save it since at the 5th year you will be paying more in taxes, permanently."
3522,"It is absolutely a small change in light of the goody bag corporations and the rich get. It is also a small change once you account for the loss of the exemption (even worse for families with older dependents who can't make up for it via the expanded child tax credit) and the switch to the chained CPI (which will make your net gain vs. prior law punier year by year until it becomes a net hike starting in 2025).

Take it from me - my leanings are partisan but I'm not an ass. I wanted to like this bill. It was absolutely an improvement on the initial House bill (which, admittedly, set the bar low).

It has about 40% good ideas. But the remaining 60% is so toxic that the whole thing becomes a steaming dung pile on net.

And that's what happens when you rush unpopular legislation through in the dead of night, without anything remotely resembling bipartisanship. And all while either pretending economic analysis of the bill doesn't exist, or trying to beat the clock because you know how bad it'll make you look."
3523,"I live in a blue state, went through the recession, saw the resetting of home prices. Saw families lose their homes in droves. They will never be able to buy a home in the same area, even with the MID change. And those who rent will never be able to afford the down payment.

Now partially this is due to mortgage products that are less fucked than what they were. But we are talking average starter hone is still $450 to $500. Demand takes over again. 

This is what’s happening in Portland, Oregon. Can’t rent any where, people are moving in because it’s cheaper than Cali. Renters are being shoved out because people can afford those homes. The MID issue doesn’t factor enough to lower homes in the area. 

So I see your point. 

Can’t drop the MID altogether otherwise you would have a housing crash again in areas that are economically improving."
3524,"> What about the new tax bill means you won't need to pay someone to do your taxes if you had been doing so before?  
  
Because the new standard deduction ends up coming in just over what my itemized deductions were last year. I used a tax person because they knew how to massage deductions where as I could miss something.  
  
So I don't need to spend that money this year. And using the standard deduction instead of the itemized also greatly decreases the risk of a future audit at some point.  
  
> Otherwise our tax cuts would be permanent and the corporate cuts would be the ones that could expire.  
  
I don't think they would have gotten the votes for the permanent, and that is a crying shame. But I suspect this will play out like the Bush Tax Cuts which were renewed by the Congressional Dems and President Obama."
3525,"I live in a blue(ish) state with massive immigration driving housing costs up as well. While political practices like the MID and zoning are driving up housing prices, at the end of the day housing prices would go up regardless because these are desirable places to live. I would just hope that absent policies inflating housing costs that salaries would be able to better keep up.

>Can’t drop the MID altogether otherwise you would have a housing crash again in areas that are economically improving.

Yes obviously you would have to ratchet down the MID gradually and grandfather people in. 

Also a point that I failed to make is that support for the MID is based on the assumption of an intrinsic value to homeownership, of which there is none. A person's residence is not an investment and this widespread mentality that it is an investment leads to political pressure for policies that consistently drive housing costs up."
3526,"> But I suspect this will play out like the Bush Tax Cuts which were renewed by the Congressional Dems and President Obama

Sure, probably - but then maybe not. We saw how Congressional Republicans were willing to vote down conservative-friendly legislation just to spite Obama - to say nothing of their willingness to play political football with the notion of the United States defaulting on its debts. Who's to say we don't see a repeat of that in 2026?"

The parallel here is that both are narcissists that are only concerned about their own perceived celebrity status and boosting their own brand. Also, that their fans are fucking sociopaths who will immediately forgive them no matter what, and that is assuming they find anything wrong with the situation to begin with, which they usually don't.

Personally, I think that Logan Paul should be absolutely shunned, and the parents should stop their children (and that is his audience, which is even more fucked up about the video he posted) should ban their kids from watching him. What he should *not* get is all of this media attention making his name more well known. "

It was only after the backlash that he came up with a stupid excuse about raising awareness and apologized and pulled the video. The completely sickening part was that his fans, who are again tweens and teens mostly, not only were ok with it, but attacked others on social media who were critical of him.

3848,"Full text below:

Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.

Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself.

Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.

We have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down.

The fact that you’re trying to make this about Trump just goes to show how much you don’t give a shit about anything that’s happening in regards to this tremendous effort to bring prosperity back to struggling communities with high incarceration rates. This is also an attempt at trying to improve the character of those who have made mistakes in the past, but have done their time.

Prison reform has nothing to do with foreign policy unless we are holding overseas prisoners here. 



The “shithole” comment actually does have some ground. It isn’t racism. Many countries are exploited by cartels and sex trafficking on a daily basis. Some are dominated by oppressive warlords who control every aspect of people’s lives. They really are actually a shithole, you can’t ignore that. That isn’t racism. 



In fact, doing the prison reform meetings actually goes to show how he *isn’t* racist because he wants to lower the pressure put upon African and Mexican American sentencing.

Trump could fund a project responsible for the people to find the cure to cancer and you’d probably still make an argument against it saying that cancer doctors would be out of jobs because Trump is a nazi who hates jews or whatever new thing you guys have come up with. 



Just because you don’t like Trump does not undermine the President or his advisors from making tremendous efforts in many communities. Much growth has ready been seen from Ben Carson in the past few months on the daily. Much growth has been seen in the Department of Labor on the daily. Just because the guy is really controversial doesn’t mean that his administration is incapable of doing good things. 



It’s time to re-evaluate the way you see stuff. Your closed mindedness is only going to result in more stupidity among you and those around you. 




This post wasn’t even supposed to be about Trump, but you guys are so hellbent on making everything about the Orange Oligarch that you’re incapable of seeing anything else happening politically.

Crude, but not homophobic."
4091,What was homophobic about it?
4092,Is this the same news organization that supported a pedophile in the AL Senate race?

4097,Anti-PC right-wingers bitch & lie because somebody is not politically correct for them.  Her commentary about Graham is not homophobic.

4105,Slammed by Fox News lol.
4106,"Not everything is ""homophobic"". It wasn't eloquent but ""homophobic""? Come on."
4107,"For Fox, this is such a circle jerk.

What, Fox and Friends ""slams"" Handler, and then Fox News runs stories to the effect of ""Pundits and analysts are slamming Chelsea Handler, etc.""  I guess this is what the right means by being bootstrappy."
4108,"Graham can suck the dick of any consenting adult he likes. I have my doubts he does so in other than the metaphorical sense, but if he does, I doubt many Americans would have a problem with it. However, a video of it is still blackmail material for two reasons: First, he's on the record as being very anti-gay, and so potentially a hypocite. Second...nobody appreciates private videos of them being released to the public. Handler's comment is crude but by no means homophobic.

Swing and a miss by Fox. Can't you guys make a more compelling distraction?"
4109,Fox News LOL. 6% upvote LOL.
4110,LMAO Fox News cares about gay rights now?
4111,"It's what everyone is thinking tbh. Live and let live, Lindsey."
4112,"I believe she was being homophobic. My problem with fox here is they (and most right wing media) love to lump all celebrities and dems together. Just because Chelsea handler says this doesn't delegitimize ""the left"" entirely. "
4113,Hypocritical left is always entertaining 
4114,"Yeah, definitely not homophobic. Crude, like you said, but in the jarring ""nobody really cares or judges you for this"" way that's supposed to indicate that there's nothing wrong with being gay.

As I hear it, it's a bit of an open secret that Graham's a ""confirmed bachelor"" who is almost definitely gay. And that's great: I think he should come out and be happy with who he is because he'll be so much more at peace with who he is. My brother's clearly gay, he came out to friends in the past, but because my parents are very homophobic, he'll never come out, and the damage that does to him is disturbingly apparent. Graham's a much older man, but who knows how much of that is coming from the perceived fear of coming out? Makes me think of the allegations about John Travolta and how Scientologists keep him in that cult due to videotapes of his ""auditing"" sessions."
4115,Factual
4116,It's like these people don't understand rhetoric
4117,Kinda hilarious. Dont tell me youve never wondered about Mister Graham
4118,"She’s suggesting that such a video would be shameful. And she’s making fun of being in the closet.

Why would it be bad for Lindsey Graham to come out if he turned out to actually be gay? What a pathetic thing to joke about."
4119,"No it's homophobic in the sense that it accepts the idea that a man would be afraid of people knowing they're actually gay. She's saying graham is acting in a disingenuous way because someone has a tape that shows him in an unfavorable light, in this case, him being homosexual. by extension, makes homosexuality unfavorable. Because, what's wrong with being gay?? "
4120,"I don't want to give Fox News page views, but I'm guessing this is one of these ""you talked about racism therefore you're a racist"" sort of games."
4121,Just a little non PC joke right? Only snowflakes would be offended by it
4122,"More of an opportunistic capitalization on social justice tropes, blown up to proportions so ridiculous as to lose meaning"
4123,"She basically implied that they have a video of Grahman engaging in gay sex and are using it to blackmail him, then she goes on to suggest that coming out would be more honorable.

Assuming there is blackmail, pulling the trigger on himself really is the only choice.  Anything else just creates more material to blackmail with (if nothing else, it creates incidents they can expose as you doing what you were told to do, even if those acts aren't themselves illegal)."
4124,Why yes it is!
4125,"My guess?

The writer has been called a homophobe before for saying anti-gay things..

Therefore they assume anyone making crude jokes that includes anything even slightly homosexual.. must also be a homophobe.

Or maybe they're just idiots.

4136,"Apparently you don't understand the words homophobia, hypocrite, or honorable. Hmm."
4137,"I have to disagree. The alt-right is way more of a clown show to watch. Already this year theres been two terrorist acts tacks by middle aged white men, Breitbart has had infighting, Trump is such a loser and needs grown adults to babysit him. 

Now thats fucking funny. "
4138,**Republicans endorsed Roy Moore.** Now they're offended by this tweet?
4139,"The *Paedophilic Right* more so, imo."
4140,"They don't..

"
4141,They don't acknowledge it because then they would have to explain to their viewers that people will often exaggerate (sometimes to ridiculous levels) for emphasis rather than to communicate true levels.
4142,"Actually nope, never really thought about it.  I know so many gay people that unless it's overtly obvious I tend not to really think about it."
4143,"When you grow up in a super conservative environment you're trained to think that it's a disease and/or a choice.  So if you're attracted to someone of the same sex there must be something wrong with you and if there's something wrong with you then how would you be accepted?  

It's not right, but that's the mindset."
4144,"No, she is suggesting that such a video would be the end of him in the GOP. Which is an accurate suggestion."
4145,"Nope.  Not homophobic.  It's only wrong or unfavorable among his people - Republicans

Edit: grammar"
4146,"If he is homosexual, which isnt a problem, his voting record makes him a huge hypocrite"
4147,Calling someone else homophobic does not make that person homophobic or else everyone accusing Handler of being homophobic would also be homophobic themselves. See how silly the logic is? All she’s doing is pointing out nobody would care if he was gay.

4149,Lololol this nonsense again....
4150,and also what's left about it? any sane person would be anti-trump. he's going to get us all killed.

4153,Wwwhhhaaaaa??? A mouth piece for the right not understand something???
4154,"This is a homophobic, offensive tweet, what am I not understanding?

Question is, will you and the rest of left denounce/condemn, or look the other way?"
4155,What were the two attacks?
4156,Like Kevin Spacey?
4157,"Never married, no children. Senator of South Carolina. With a soft lilting voice, and a long history of anti-gay voting.

Kinda screams in the closet"
4158,Yep. It's homophobic. She's using the idea of homosexuality to insult him. 
4159,She's using a well known stereotype. There's no need to defend her here. It's like when someone calls someone gay but then saying they really meant bad or corny. 
4160,Agreed but not the point 
4161,Exactly. It’s like when people call Republicans “racist” or “Nazi” but can’t point to any evidence of those things. Just calling them a name doesn’t make it true. It’s just a way to smear people they disagree with.
4162,"Not sure what you mean since handler didn't call Graham homophobic. She said he was gay as if it were bad. And also, she told him to come out of the closet. Suppose he was gay, doesn't he have the right to come out when he wants? "
4163,"It sounds like she's using typical republican fears against him.  Many in the GOP who happen to be gay are afraid of their sexuality so it's a deeply held secret.  She's crudely poking fun at the mindset, not actually being gay."
4164,"Oh look, it's the bigot who thinks ""you"" means ""all white people everywhere."""
4165,"Chelsea Handler isn't a homophobe. She's not afraid of gay people or hostile toward them. 

If Lindsey Graham is being blackmailed the honorable thing to do would be to just admit it. 

What's so hard to understand? There's nothing wrong with sucking cock. Just come out, admit it, and get the monkey off his back. 

Maybe there's another reason why Graham has turned his back on his principles and all of the things he said about Trump in the past but blackmail seems as solid an explanation as any other. Most people don't just flip like that when they feel so strongly. "

1) a lot of southern men develop that way of speaking. It isn't a huge red flag or anything.
 
2)  i have it on good authority that the guy really likes Elton John. But again, anyone with two ears and a heart should be a fan. But I mean Lindsay Graham is a superfan. "

4173,"Yeah but I still really don't think about it much, even the high profile people.  It doesn't occur to me to put those pieces together.  "
4174,"The tweet is talking about how someone must have a compromising video of him performing a homosexual act, which they are holding over him, because they know a person like Graham would not like it to be made public as the people he associates with hate homosexuals.   Everything she said was factual.  It's nothing like your example.  You either can't recognize nuance and context or you refuse to.  Either way, you're wrong. "
4175,"I would think that the Republicans being found guilty repeatedly of racist gerrymandering is evidence that they are racist. 

Not to mention the GOP politicians that keep resigning due to their racist remarks like saying black people are genetically predisposed to drug abuse. 

Or how neo Nazis openly campaign on Republican tickets. 

But nice try with that straw man. It sure was pretty easy to beat up. "
4176,"Ah, you’re one of those that demand only literal quotes and can’t read subtext I see. Discussions with individuals like yourself are frivolous and fruitless so I’ll leave you with this and ignore any further attempt from you to muddy the issue. 

Handler obviously implied that Graham is homophobic for concealing his identity. You do yourself a disservice trying to play semantic word games rather than engaging in honest discussion. "
4177,alt account of an alt account. I'm not sure but i think he's avoiding a ban too.
4178,"I'm not the one that talked down on ""Brown"" people...as you so eloquently put it lol"
4179,"So you're condoning possible blackmail? Typical lefty tactics. Also, you have no idea what it is like to be in the closet. As a SJW once said: Check your privilege "
4180,Constructive response
4181,"Well you should be more aware of your surroundings

:/"
4182,But she doesn't know of any tape. That part isn't a fact. She's using it to insult him. Which is homophobic 
4183,I'm not doing myself a disservice at all. She went right to homosexuality with Graham even though that hasn't come up with recently in his support of defiance of trump. She introduced it and used it as a weapon; as an insult. 
4184,"No, no I did not. I didn't even mention brown people. That was all you."
4185,"No. I didn't say anything remotely like that. I'm sure being in the closet sucks but I don't have any sympathy for him if it is causing harm to this country. 

Admitting what you're being blackmailed about completely disarms the blackmailer. It's the opposite of condoning blackmail. It's standing against it. Condoning blackmail is complying with their demands."
4186,"Oh knock it off, I only have so much energy to process the world and worrying about politicians' sexual orientation isn't a priority for me."
4187,"She's clearly *speculating* that there must be a tape to get her point across.  She may be insulting him, but what you fail to comprehend is that she is criticizing his behavior of doing a 180 and supporting Trump.  There's nothing in her tweet to suggest she thinks being gay is bad or wrong.  That's the context you - and you alone - are supplying to it. The only thing suggested in her tweet is that Graham doesn't want people to think he's gay. 

  "
4188,"Just as I thought, you're not really interested in discussion, just playing semantics. Have a good day!"
4189,Meanwhile on reddit....
4190,"I never said I think that handler thinks being gay is bad. I said she's accepting or perpetuating that notion that one can use the word gay or the suggestion of it as bad. That it's a bad thing to say about a man. 

Think if she said, ""Graham is acting like a Jew"" or ""Lindsay graham os so inconsistent he's basically Italian"""
4191,"Fucking around on the internet while I'm in ""hurry up and wait"" mode at work does not equal me having the energy either inside or outside of work to worry about or give a shit about someones sexual orientation.  "
4192,"It's only ""accepting or perpetuating the notion that one can use the word gay or the suggestion of it as bad"" if people like you give it that meaning.  Your examples are not at all analogous.  Try this one:

In a hypothetical country, one half of the politicians think eating red apples is bad and immoral.  Let's call them the bad apple party.  The other half totally rejects that way of thinking.  One day, a member of the bad apple party, who was formerly against President of the bad apple party, decides to heap praise on the President.  This causes someone to comment that someone must have a video of the member eating a red apple because that's the only way to explain this 180 change.  

Now does that make the person a red-apple-phobe? Or is the better answer that the person was using the other person's irrational bias against him to prove a point?"
4193,"Ok, thats 4 in a row youve said it. We get it.

Although id like to present to the jury, your commenting in a reddit thread about Lindsey Graham's sexuality, as exhibit A"
4194,All you did was replace gay with red apple. Graham supported the president and defied on something completely unrelated to homosexuality . Handler introduced this to the conversation to attack him and chose to use homosexuality as a weapon.

Yo, WSJ... you can't just drop that in the interview and not provide more details. Publish the full interview transcript please"
4197,"Highlights

- An FBI agent who texted someone his opinions about Trump ""amounted to treason""

- On Mexico paying for his wall, he's going to say getting a better deal on NAFTA counts as them paying. He doesn't realize that countries don't make payments to each other as part of NAFTA... 

> “They can pay for it indirectly through Nafta,” Mr. Trump said. “We make a good deal on Nafta, and, say, I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying.”

- What is he looking for overall from a NAFTA deal? Just ""a Trump deal""

> On the broader renegotiation of Nafta, he said he would terminate the agreement unless the sides could agree on a fair deal—""a Trump deal,” he called it

- He blamed Republicans for not working on libel laws. He also did not know that libel laws only exist at the state, not federal level.

> Mr. Trump offered an unsolicited rebuttal to “Fire and Fury,” saying it showed the need for new libel laws. But he acknowledged that was unlikely to happen, saying that the Republican-controlled Congress doesn’t have the “guts” for that debate.

> Libel claims are a matter of state rather than federal law, buttressed by constitutional protections.

- Even though he's tweeted insults at Kim Jong Un, they could still be best friends

> “You’ll see that a lot with me,” he said about combative tweets, “and then all of the sudden somebody’s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You could give me 30. I’m a very flexible person.”

- North Korea is trying to create a wedge between the US & South Korea by competing at the Olympics, but that's fine because he's knows wedges.

> “The difference is I’m president, other people aren’t,” he said. “And I know more about wedges than any human being that’s lived.”"

4202,So stable 
4203,"He also brings up libel again saying that the law will likely not change because Congress lacks the guts to debate it. Libel is a state issue. There is no federal defamation laws.

Another gem is his claim that renegotiating nafta could get us the money to build the wall: “We make a good deal on Nafta, and, say, I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying.”

4289,$40 a paycheck is twice as much as the one time bonus of $1000 that amounts to $19 a paycheck for a single year. Yes $2000+ every year is more than $1000 (Minus all applicable taxes. So it's more like $750.) for one year. And that $40 didn't accompany a huge transfer of wealth from working people to the filthy rich. And the tax cuts didn't default to tax hikes.

1.  a $40 increase in a paycheck comes out to $2,000 per year, every year, quite a bit more than a $1,000 bonus.

2.  The bulk of the Obama tax cut went to middle class workers, as opposed to these so called tax cut bonuses and raises which amount to less than 1/2 of 1% of this tax giveaway to the rich and corporations.

Giving actual people more money in their paychecks through needed tax cuts in an economic downturn is one of the best ways to stimulate the economy.

Giving tax cuts to corporations who are experiencing record profits when unemployment is at record lows is reckless, wasteful and stupid."

a $1,000 bonus after tax is typically $750 or less, (it works out to about $680 for me)

considering not everyone gets these $1,000 bonuses (just certain employees from these companies who have announced the bonuses) and considering that $40 per paycheck on average for every American which comes out to over $2,000 per year, for as long as the tax cut is in place, and also considering how much less expensive that tax cut would have been compared to this behemouth, Pelosi is not contradicting herself.

You're being a bit dishonest. Of the $1.5 trillion number ([JCT](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5053)), only ~$650 billion is on the business side for FY 2018-2027. Roughly double that is on the individual side.

I didn't see any of that nuance in the report of her comments. Here's what I *did* see: ""pathetic,"" ""crumbs,"" ""insignificant."" If you asked the people receiving those bonuses what they thought, what do you think they'd say? Pelosi is out of touch here, but she is a wealthy politician. "

It is insignificant.”

corporate America recieves million dollar bonuses on the regular, and these companies are touting $1,000 bonuses like they are a huge deal.

Like I said, if a company wants to reward their workers, that's fine, but it really is just an example of how pitiful the trickle down economics idea is.  

If big companies are going to use this $650 billion to do stock buy backs and provide dividends to its wealthy investors, and throw a few crumbs to its workers in the form of $1,000 bonuses announced to every media outlet in the country who is the real winner here?"
4326,We'll see. 
4327,"Just as people (Walmart) are trying to purport that these raises and bonuses are due to the tax plan. The proponents of trickle-down economics suggest that the Walmart's of the world are job creators and will thusly increase employment, work hours, wages and bonuses based on their receiving the egregious tax break that they did.

What I'm suggesting is that, removing the tax plan at all, Walmart would have still raised its minimum wage because it is currently competitive to do so. Its main competitors, places like Target, are doing the exact same thing. Similarly, they would have also closed the stores and laid off employees, because that was still going to happen regardless. Only one of these things is positive news that they can claim as justification for the ridiculous tax breaks they were given.

It is a PR move, plain and simple to claim credit to the tax plan."

4333,"No. It's going to be terrible when the tax cuts expire. They're planning on cutting vital programs that working people rely on to get by. They want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and so much more. That's going to be terrible for working people. "

This speaks more to the problems of American education and our often revisionist history in choosing to whitewash a lot of things we are embarrassed of instead of accepting the truth and moving forward. 

Yes Italians were treated like shit. But so were natives, Irish, Chinese, Polish, Japanese, Jews, women, homosexuals, atheists, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other groups.

Much like the confederate statues, these should be removed, without a lot of fanfare, and replaced with more appropriate ones.

If you want to dump them in a museum or exhibit, fine, but we should not be celebrating Columbus. "
4397,How bout we let all this IDOLATROUS stuff go....
4398,[deleted]
4399,"Columbus's behavior as a leader was pretty much standard for the time. There was nothing really that much worse about him. What was remarkable though is that he was willing to cross a massive ocean into the unknown when no one else wanted to do so. A lot of immigrants did the same journey to come to America so its not a surprise people identify with him because they went on a similar voyage. I think people need to look at him l as a type of symbol and less as a person. If you are going to judge him or anyone else from that time for that matter through a 2018 world view of how humans should conduct themselves then we will have no one left to look up to. Everyone pretty much sucked as a person back then.

I understand why Latinos say we shouldnt be looking up to people who brought colonialism to the Americas and everything else that came with it. However, who they should really be mad at is the Catholic Church. The colonialists might have killed a lot of people and taken a lot of stuff, but it was the church that was responsible for systematically wiping out most of the cultures that existed in the Americas from before the Europeans came. Yet you wont hear anyone bitching about the Church for some reason."
4400,"The Confederate and Lee statues were put up specifically to intimidate African americans, so what the statues are and were meant to symbolize is radically different. 

Not that this is your point, but putting the respinability for everything that happened in the America’s On Columbus’s shoulders is unfair. Remember that 15the century Europe was brutal, and he would have been seeing the end of the Reconquista and been growing up in a Europe where racial identity theory was starting to form, so he’s a product of his time as opposed to some sort of horrific outlier. 

I personally think we should change the holidays name, but Columbus gets more shit than he deserves (which is still a lot). "
4401,How is this an example of extremism?
4402,"I disagree with that. His behavior was abhorrent. Just because there were others (like the Spanish that raped South America) does not mean he should get a pass. The reason he is loved is due to us having a predominantly euro-centric mindset, and the fact that he was re-written to be beloved in this country for so long. 

If you want someone, why not Amerigo Vespucci? Or, as most places are doing, the people that were already here when he got here. They originally had to come from somewhere as well. "
4403,"I hear a lot of people bitch about the Catholic Church but maybe I spend too much time in atheism subreddits. We don't much care for ""what-about-ism"" here. (It's a tactic used by alt-righters and closet racists. Other people use it too but those two groups seem to be the most common in this sub.) We also don't see monuments honoring the Catholic Church on public property like we do Columbus.

We could just as easily honor Erik the Red for exploration. We could choose to honor crews of those voyages specifically. We could honor the Polynesians who made their way to Hawaii. Why stick to nautical themes? ""There are too many William Penn and Anne Hutchinson monuments,"" said no one ever. 

No one is mad at Columbus. We're just not sure guy who sailed for the express purpose of finding the fastest route to that sweet silk and spice money and mucked some shit up on the way is a guy we want to honor. The reason no one else went before that was because Columbus thought the globe was a lot smaller than it is. I'm hoping our nation's habit of honoring terrible idiots who luck into glory will end with Trump.
"
4404,"Oh for sure the confederate ones were / are worse. And I'm not saying Columbus should be forgotten. That was my point about putting it in a museum or a specific exhibit where his *full* history can be shown, warts and all. Not just a statute glorifying him on public land. "
4405,"> Just because there were others (like the Spanish that raped South America) does not mean he should get a pass.

What do you think the Aztecs were doing at the time? The reason Cortez even managed to beat the Aztecs was because they were so fucking hated by their neighbors that they all decided to support Cortez and provide him with tens of thousands of troops. The Aztecs where just as hellbent on conquest and domination as the Spanish. They just lacked the technology to do so. 

I didnt say he should get a pass. Who should definitely not get a pass though is the church though because they are still around and still profiting from the conquests."
4406,"You know, I agree with you on all of that. Especially the church. And yes, to your earlier point, there were a lot of butchers and terrible people back in that era. 

And I get that we need heroes, and the last few years have been incredibly hard on those that we thought we had. But we need to make sure the ones we do raise up are worth it. And in the instance of Columbus, not simply because we thought him as one for a long time. "

4416,That's a truly terrible opinion piece.

4418,"Strange that the only thing from the book he quotes  has been said by several people in different contexts - that Trump doesn't read, doesn't have the concentration to do it, hates doing it. 
I guess that was the only part of the book the writer managed to read  before he was asked to buy the book or leave. "
4419,"The whole part of ‘Fire and Fury’ where the author implied that Trump couldn’t read, or could only read headlines really threw me. Hasn’t Trump been proven to read some speeches from teleprompters, and isn’t being able to read headlines by definition being able to read?

""Trump didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. If it was print, it might as well not exist. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semiliterate  . . . .

4532,The article fails to mention Walmart is closing 63 Sam's Club stores to keep their net profit and hell probably get a tax write-off for taking a loss. 
4533,This anecdotal stuff is all nonsense. Call me a couple years down the line when we have actual macro data on how wages changed along with cost of living. 
4534,Right? Greeters and restockers deserve $15 an hour to do work that requires skills taught in under 15 minutes! 
4535,"Yeah you're right, I guess they should just keep their minimum wage at what it is and not raise it to $11/hr because it's not perfect. /s

It's honestly amazing how leftists treat politics like a team sport:

Trump dropped the TPP? Now I don't like it!

Walmart raised their minimum wage because of Trump? This is now bad!


Children. "
4536,The more meaningful thing is the increase in hourly rate. There is a permanence to that which a one-time bonus cannot match.
4537,"A full-time employee works around 1750 hours a year. The starting wage went up from 9 to 11 dollars, so by 2$/h. That adds up to a bonus of 3500$/year. Add the bonus of $1000, and you're at $4500 per full time employee. 

I think that is pretty major increase for their employees. Even though Walmart still has a huge profit, the tax cuts clearly benefit their employees. I fail to see how that's a bad thing. "
4538,"That's such a stupid way to look at it lol. That's like this: tax cuts upped your yearly income to 100,000. You order a pizza. You have a lot more expendable income than last year, so you give the pizza man a generous 30$ tip. But he's not happy. He knows you make a lot more money this year, so he demands a 500$ tip every time he delivers your pizza, even for a menial task. He argues that you would still be able to live off your income and still give him 500$ tips. This sub doesn't believe that people are allowed to make money because you all don't seem to make any "
4539,Thx for the math on this
4540,Like no new hires as full time.  Schedule all full time to 36 hours per week. No overtime...at all costs.  Cut part time to 20 hours per week.  
4541,"Except every company that is announcing pay raises or bonuses to their employees are also laying off hundreds if not thousands quietly.

This isn't the sign of a strong economy, this is a sign of political posturing. Its easy to increase spending on employees when you are receiving billions in free tax money and STILL are cutting jobs/benefits to pay for your newest round of 'corporate reinvestment'."
4542,"More like 10,000.  At least 60 Sam's Club stores are closing, each one has around 175 employees according to one article I saw today."
4543,You mean stockers? They get paid much more than cashiers. The majority of them work overnight. That's a huge commitment when you consider the strain it has on family and the ability to actually get an education. Greeters have been in the process of being phased out. So you think the government should subsidize walmart by giving out welfare because they don't pay their employees enough to live off their full time job?
4544,"Because a 1 dollar raise is not going to do anything to stop the government from having to pay out welfare. Since you're so smart, what makes it okay that the government has to subsidize walmart's wages through welfare? Which we have to foot that bill. "
4545,"See, you say that, but just remember that many states have already or are in the process of raising their minimum wages to near that level anyway (or higher in some cases).  Many WalMart employees would be getting that wage regardless of the tax bill."
4546,"A dollar an hour raise to entry level workers is better than the meager bonus, but it's still a drop in the bucket.  It would have been cheaper if the taxpayers just gave every entry level worker a dollar an hour for every hour they work than to give the massive tax cuts to WalMart"
4547,"Actually it went up from $10 to $11.  The $9/hour rate is what they get paid while they have their training. 

Also only entry level people get the $1/hour raise, so it doesn't have an impact on the vast majority of workers.  Also the bonuses are ""up to $1000"", so the majority of workers will be getting less than that.  Full Time employees aren't getting anywhere close to $4,500, and in fact most of them will at most be getting $1,000 (one time)

And if you bothered to read what I wrote, you'd know that Wal Mart already makes more than enough to boost their employee pay without having to get another handout from the taxpayers of this country.  Hell we already subsidize their profits because it's our tax dollars that make sure their employees don't starve to death."
4548,Actually it's a great way of looking at it.  The stated goal of these tax cuts is to boost the economy  We are giving these corporations billions of dollars and they are passing along pennies to workers.  
4549,"Hmmm, its weird how with all those quiet layoffs the economy is at record lows of unemployment, showing accelerating GDP growth that Obama said the US would never see again, repatriating hundreds of billions in corporate cash, and just all around killing it. 

Kinda makes it seem like you're full of shit and just grasping at anything you can to try and disparage Trump."
4550,"Oh, I remember. But I also remember that Walmart is the nation's largest employer and they are raising wages across the board. So you can exalt government and write off Walmart's wage increase (which is what the left has been campaigning for years), but it didn't take the feds forcing the company to do a thing. If anything, a departure from big government [via the reduction in corporate taxes] spurred Walmart's decision. "
4551,[deleted]

and 

>  Currently, Walmart's starting wage is $9

You assume the extra pay increase for completing the training will be gone, but that is not what I'm reading in this article. 

Also, don't forget they are getting extra benefits on top of that pay increase. "
4554,~$4500/ year plus maternity leave  for unskilled work= pennies. Try not to go out of your way to hope this is a bad thing.
4555,"Talk to me in two years, and you won't be able to blame the new democrat majority either. The Recession is coming."
4556,"Mmm, no it didn't.  This was happening regardless of taxes changing.   A wage increase for 1.5 million people doesn't happen in a week, this has been in the works for months.  Not to mention the fact that matching minimum wage *is* them being forced to pay more by the government (state government in this case).  Nice try though.  By the way, they're also laying off ~~hundreds~~ thousands and the bonus they're touting is only for 20 year employees.

EDIT: 63 Sam's Club stores closing.  I suppose that's Wal-mart helping wealth trickle down, too, right?  "
4557,"63 Sam's Clubs are closing, whoops."
4558,Yes the tax bill that gave hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations cost the taxpayers money because that shortfall is going to have to be made up elsewhere. 
4559,"If they were raising their starting pay to $12 they would be promoting it.  The $9/hr is for training and it's boosted to $10 upon completion.  It's a $1/hr raise.

Also a lot of states already are boosting their minimum wage to at least that much, so an even smaller number of people will benefit.  

And no they really aren't getting extra benefits."
4560,"Except it's nowhere near $4,500 a year.  It's a dollar an hour raise.  And the only people who get the $1,000 ONE TIME bonus are people who have been with the company for 20 years.  

So yeah, it's pennies compared to the billions the corporation is getting.  It would have been cheaper if the taxpayers just gave the money directly to the handful of workers getting the raise"
4561,"I look forward to us speaking 2 years from now, when the market is at 30k+ and you're still whining about how poor you are and how unfair the economy is.

Market will be up another 30% by year end.  Start investing your tips."
4562,[deleted]
4563,"Yes, the $9/hr is the **starting** wage before training. That one goes up to $11/hr. 

The training itself is 90 days long. After that, you can't call your wage a 'starting wage' anymore. 

The pay increase after training (which is not mandatory, and doesn't train anywhere near all employees), is to incentivize said training for Total Quality Management (TQM). It would make zero sense for them to just abolish a working program by canceling that training fee.

Hence I think your assumption is wrong here, although i acknowledge the article OP linked isn't really clear about this.

4566,No the lack of revenue created the shortfall
4567,"Regardless of semantics, $11/hr is a pitiful wage.  Especially when you consider the company makes $15 Billion+ in profit every year yet still relies on taxpayers to feed a significant portion of their workforce.  "
4568,"It’s not even that. It’s about $1,500-1,700 for new employees only. The full bonus only goes to 20 year employees which aren’t that many. 

And 400 million one time in exchange for billions every year. It’s a joke. "

Please do.  I'm sure that will be the $100 that finally brings down Drumpf!"

4571,"Well, it is in line with wages in for example Europe. Carrefour pays their low level employees €8 ($9.63) per hour. And note that in Europe, the taxes are alot higher (~20% for Europe, ~15% and soon ~12% in the US)."
4572,Walmart greeters obviously deserve 10x what they're getting here. $1500-1700/year is pittance. They deserve at least $50k annual raises so that they can finally be paid for their innovative and dynamic contribution to our economy.
4573,oh you're so cute.
4574,The difference is Europe has extensive social programs that help citizens.  If you get sick in Europe you can see a doctor without going bankrupt for example.

4739,"> Still waiting for the part where you prove me wrong with facts. 

Wrong about what? You're arguing that Meryl Streep didn't call Weinstein God despite my posting video of her calling Weinstein God. You say Weinstein lost everything, when in fact he is still incredibly wealthy and has done zero time for his crimes. Do you think he cares his name isn't going to be on movies anymore when he has millions of dollars stashed away and tons of investments that support his fabulously wealthy lifestyle? For decades people like Streep ignored Weinstein's behavior because it benefited them to and their silence led to the suffering of who knows how many women. Fact is, none of these celebrities who say they're disgusted by these ""revelations"" actually cares about the victims. They care about money and they recognize it's bad for business if their fans believe they were complicit in allowing sex criminals to walk free. Because those fans are desperate to believe someone cares, because they are desperate to believe in heroes, those fans reduce the dissonance and supplant reality with a false reality that reinforces the delusions that make them feel better about life. Streep didn't know, they tell themselves, neither did Oprah, and anyone who says otherwise must be part of the political opposition, and therefore their words are invalid. You're making an emotional argument that you hope negates Streep's hypocrisy because you agree with her criticisms of Trump and because it makes you feel good to believe there are people out there with power who care. Well, there aren't. You and your emotions are useful to the Left, just like the emotions of pissed off white trash are useful to the Right."

[By literally a fraction of a percent.](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/363150-goldman-sachs-gop-tax-bills-boost-to-economy-would-be-minimal-at-best)  This effectively does nothing to the economy.  Added up over the entirety of the bills lifetime, it works out to like 1.4% growth.  To blow a 1.5 trillion dollar hole in the budget.  1.4%.

>generate more money in returns for most Americans

Most Americans are going to get what amounts to $100 a month while seeing their health care costs go up because of the repeal of the ACA mandate which is going to have wide spread impacts on everyones insurance rates, not just the individual market, effectively ruining any savings in tax returns.  And that is well before you even consider indirect costs like poor infrastructure development that causes you to bring you car in for more maintenance because the roads suck, inability to get to work because rapid transit is old and decaying, etc.

That ""generally true"" thing you're talking about is generally horse shit.  This bill is a disaster dude.  It's not really a debate.  There was plenty the republicans could have done to make it a worthwhile bill but it just isn't.

And all that is besides the point that if the bill does somehow create crazy economic growth, we're already in a boom cycle.  The Fed will step in and do things like increase interest rates to pull that growth back down to basically the level we're at right now to stave off things like demand pull inflation which will fuck everything up.

"
4767,">The Tax bill does not improve the economy much and its very bad for Usa for long term

I agree with this, but I am not in a position of power to do anything about it, so I will be cautiously optimistic that at least a few of the Republican's ""Pie In The Sky"" promises about how it will stimulate the economy may happen. My gut tells me no, though.

"
4769,"> What does that math work out to - take $1.4T out of the coffers to put $2.4T back into the GDP?

Uh, no, it doesn't work out that way. At all.  It's 1.4-1.5 Trillion hole using the Republicans ""dynamic scoring"" - which they made up this year, by the way, just to make sure they stayed under the Byrd Rule - and maybe getting 400 billion back into the economy.

>[Second, most economists don't think this is anywhere near a close call. “At best, according to the prevailing consensus, the positive feedback effect from tax cuts would recoup in the range of 25 percent to 35 percent of the cost,” wrote, you guessed it, Holtz-Eakin.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/07/for-the-last-time-tax-cuts-dont-pay-for-themselves/?utm_term=.3e4f3441b0a6)

That number doesn't really change based off any time frame you make the estimate.  These tax cuts don't put shit back into the economy.

They're literally just going to blame Democrats.  That's all they've done for the past decade."
4770,"A tax cut can not pay for itself and still stimulate the economy in excess of the cut. The pay for itself part refers to government revenue. The economy part refers to GDP. It is a philosophical question whether you think that money is better served by being in the hands of the government or in the economy at large. Definitely pros and cons to each side of the argument.

We'll see what happens on healthcare. I'm generally not a fan of cramming a skinny repeal into a tax bill. But at the same time, the individual mandate is deeply unpopular. GOP's turn to try and fix this problem. I doubt blaming the Dems will be an effective strategy for anyone up for reelection in a competitive district."

They hoard it and it gets taken out of the economy.  It's not circulating anywhere.  It's collecting at the top and large corporations are using it as cover to lay off people while they throw one time bonuses at their workers.

"
4772,"I mean, just by the definition of GDP (value of all goods and services produced in a year), the money is entering the economy. Now where does the wealth generated by this economic activity go? Fair question. But it seems unlikely that it will all be siphoned off into off shore holdings."

Google, Apple, and FB I'm sure would love to be as socially diverse and as young and open-minded as possible with bustling environments and optimism. But how much does Google pay in taxes? Do employees in Silicon Valley really care if their hardware comes from countries with garbage human rights records and literal slave wages? What does the neighborhood surrounding Cupertino look like? Heard there were a ton of people living out of cars and RVs. Why are all the Walmarts and dollar stores across the bay over in Oakland? Again, individuals themselves probably do care, but the companies they work for don't, mostly because they were never designed to."

4834,"There is massive milk overproduction in Wisconsin. In 2016, more than 2,000,000 gallons were dumped. There are more dairy cows in the state of Wisconsin than there are dairy cows in the ENTIRE country of Canada. Just how much milk does Paul Ryan think we can drink? It's annoying that the dairy overproduction in the US is suddenly our fault."
4835,"As to the dairy situation, have the US dairy farmers get rid of their US dairy subsidies both federal and state and then we can start to talk."
4836,the real problem is with american politicians having zero clue what they're talking about. 
4837,I would argue that Ryan is part of the real problem.

4841,"Well, I offer a counter point.  Paul Ryan is an asshole."
4842,Great...Trump's gonna want ANOTHER wall
4843,Why the fuck are the Republicans suddenly picking on our closest ally and neighbor? WTF are you guys doing? Seriously? WTF is you plan? 
4844,When both goods and services controlled under NAFTA are considered then the United States under NAFTA has a trade surplus with Canada.  So what is the problem that Ryan sees with the US having a trade surplus?

4847,"Well, it's for all those children he wants us to get to making to fix things. "
4848,"While we're at it, the U.S can also put an end to the corn subsidies which allow for cheap cattle feed. The U.S subsidizes the shit out of their industries, so for them to throw shade at everyone else is indicative of American hypocrisy.

Canada will bunker down and wait for the Trumpsaster to end. "
4849,"No, but that's the good kind of welfare for the US. Sticking to outdated technology and food sources because our farmers are the back bone of America.  What do we do if another country cuts off our food supply?  It's not like we can immediately plant crops or breed cows!  That's like finding those rare diamonds. Some things just need to be protected. The American way. "
4850,"Canada would have increased American producers access to the dairy market under TTP. If anyone halfway intelligent was in charge of NAFTA talks they would have looked to TTP as a starting point... but no, they think they can tell another nation how to runs it’s dairy industry, and blow it up, all for the profit of Americans. Not likely.

It’s not Canada’s job to buy your excess milk Wisconsin."

4895,What many overt racists think. You don't just get to parse this away?

4899,"You do know ""both"" is the real answer..."
4900,"I don't get why much of the media can't take patterns into account. We have 40 years of Trump comments on the record. Yes, he is a racist."
4901,"Trump says what many racists think as well as what they SAY themselves, because he is a racist. What's new is a president so backward and hostile that he says these things in his official capacity and harms America's reputation, American business interests in those countries, and American diplomacy world wide. Its almost as if someone seeking to harm America is pulling his strings."
4902,"Maybe racists.

Personally I've never found myself thinking ""Boy, I bet there's no one of worth in Haiti. Or Botswana. Or, frankly, anywhere except here and maybe Norway.""

"
4903,What a stupid question.  It can be overt racism and something many people think at the same time. 
4904,"Por que no los dos?

Plainly, many think “I’d like to kill that bastard,” from time to time. Doesn’t make it acceptable to go out and kill all of those bastards, or even shout about doing it."
4905,It's no secret that many Americans are racists. 
4906,Most people understand why people from Norway don’t want to come here as immigrants 
4907,"Sadly, those two aren’t mutually exclusive. "
4908,"Both, many are overt racists."
4909,"Africa and Haiti don't come up in daily conversations for me.  

But, if someone did tell me they were from Africa, I don't think the first words out of my mouth would be ""Why does America have to let people like you from shithole countries in?  Why can't we have nicer people from Norway?""

I also don't look at all the folks of Asian descent at my work and tell them I think they'd be excellent at forging foreign peace policy with North Korea."
4910,30 % are both.

4912,"Trump says a lot of dumb shit, but this I think most people would agree with.

Haiti is an extremely poor 3rd world country.  El Salvador has horrendous crime.  Most of Africa is made up of extremely poor economies run by despots, and the stories of child soldiers and rape and slaughter coming out of there are mortifying.  I would call those countries ""shitholes"" too.

Now, are all the people who come from those countries bad?  No.  Should the president be calling any country a shithole?  No.  But the actual quote, it's not terribly controversial IMO. "
4913,Meanwhile Pelosi makes openly racist comments publicly and no one cares. 
4914,I was gonna say: how 'bout both?

Maybe the problem is you give a fuck about inconsequential bullshit."
4929,"If you don’t mind me asking, where do you live? Geography plays a big role in the American experience. Generally speaking, urban America is more tolerant than rural America, and there’s more racism south of the Mason-Dixon Line."
4930,"You might say Haiti is a shithole, right?"
4931,I'm a proud Southerner. We know how bad it feels when people dismiss the South as being nothing but illiterate racist rednecks. Prejudice is only useful for hurting people.
4932,"I mentioned this to a poster yesterday. **Anytime** a post on Reddit or especially r/politics even makes a whisp of the south people start coming out of the woodwork to call it or the Midwest ""Shitholes,"" like...*constantly*

Yet suddenly they're all up in arms. Bunch of filthy hypocrites imo.   "
4933,"Yeah, why is the South and Midwest ok to discriminate against? People who would never use a racial slur have no problem being prejudiced against fellow Americans based solely on which state they live in. "
4934,"Here's the thing: I'm from the south, I was freely able to travel to the ""coastal elite"" cities, despite people calling my home a shithole (and, it was). Haitians don't have that same luxury because Trump is being discriminatory toward ALLOWING THEM IN THE COUNTRY. The point isn't that he thinks the country's in ruin with a shitty government, its that he made a blanket statement  that the people who live there aren't worthy of being in America, but White Affluent Europeans are. 

There's your difference. That's how calling the south a shithole is just an insult and calling Haiti a shithole unworthy of immigration status is discriminatory and racist as fuck. 

Also the south is made up of every color, religion, and nationality of person. No one's saying a specific color of southerner sucks (oh, except racist white southerners...)

Also also no one is prejudiced against southerners. In fact the best people you meet in coastal cities are the ones who left the south... we just call southern states on their backwards policies and the voters who made those policies possible, you know... the majority of the south? "
4935,"Yes, exactly.  The same people who say all kinds of terrible things about the south/Appalachia all of a sudden are triggered when Trump insults other countries.

4964,"Dude pushed the both sides are the same bs, definitely Kremlin talking points."
4965,"Like Obama was rejected? Bear in mind that prior to the Presidency, his experience was really just making a nice speech and being de facto appointed to a Senate seat with which he did nothing noteworthy.

Or how about Hillary Clinton? She certainly had 'experience'. But normally when you're looking for a candidate with experience, you want that experience to demonstrate competency rather than ineptitude.

There are plenty of Democrats with credible experience for the Presidency - but the party hasn't picked any of them since 2004."

Once more, with feeling, *No.*"
4978,You deserve no reasonable response for promoting this pseudoscience selling conwoman. She is the liberal Trump with better PR. The fewer articles about her potential candidacy are shared the better it is for everyone.

4991,"Too bad for you it’s a democracy, I guess. If someone writes the articles I will post them, and you can downvote them, and I can complain the downvotes are breaking the rules, and the mods can ignore me. Free country."
4992,"Obama was not a 'constitutional scholar'. He was a guy who went to law school and was tapped by the University of Chicago to lecture about law - due to his celebrity rather than his legal background. He has no published scholarship in the field.

While Obama could be argued to have 'worked his way up to the Senate', he didn't do so *as a politician*. He was handed the seat in a non-competitive race. He won his seat in U.S. Senate after his opponent dropped out before the election. In neither case, he was not a particularly noteworthy legislator at any level.

No matter what you think of Obama as a President or person, you're deluding yourself if you believe his qualifications for office were remotely in line with the norm.

The only Presidents with similarly minimal political qualifications were national/international figures renowned for their executive expertise (such as Taylor, Hoover, Grant and Eisenhower)."

No it's not. It's similar, but it's held by private/publicly traded companies that have rules that you agree to abide by when you use them.

Don't like their rules? Create your own alternative. Again, Capitalism, snowflake.

>YouTube arbitrarily decided that many conservative videos should be demonetized.

You mean advertisers didn't want to have their content hosted on those videos. Again, _Capitalism_, snowflake.

>It’s easy to say, “Build your own social media website and compete with them,” but we’re talking about companies with billions of dollars and monopolistic control of their markets. The obvious solution would be to break these companies up or to at least acknowledge their importance to modern society and regulate them heavily, but conservatives don’t seem to be interested enough in either solution to even THREATEN to do this.

One moment they're loudly claiming to be the party of civil rights, the next they're fight tooth and nail to restrict the rights of Americans based on their sexual orientation. One moment they're for free market capitalism, the next they're crying about how it's treating them unfairly. It's... just their thing, man."
5059,Does anyone feel like Facebook is about to slash their own profits horribly?
5060,> *Number 11 will shock you!*
5061,You used up a field worth of straw for that man.
5062,Look at all the things you invented 
5063,"What civil rights? Is social media, they have terms of service."
5064,"Technically the idea of a free market is a liberal argument too. Almost everything American conservatives think are the opposite of liberalism is actually just a branch of liberalism. Free market, freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, you know what, pretty much the entire bill of rights are liberal ideas, and American conservatives are always acting like those are not liberal ideas because back when these ideals were cemented into the ideology of the new nation, conservatism was about strong government rule, with less freedom of speech, religion, or the press. Conservatism back then would have been things like British loyalists. They take this old mentality of conservatism vs liberalism that was going on in the past, and then use it today, except that conservatism in the US has shifted to the left of where it was before. Traditional values of this nation have shifted from being British subjects and having less freedom to the people, to, the very fundamental freedoms that our founding fathers wished to establish. American Liberalism and American Conservatism are no longer on opposite on the left-right political spectrum. 

Another thing is that people no longer think of things as purely liberal vs conservative. When people often go, ""Libruls are this!"" or ""Conservatives are that!"" they're not actually thinking of liberalism and conservatism and what they mean in the US and the world, they're just seeing Democrats vs Republicans. Liberal is being used to refer to Democrats, and Conservative is being used for Republican. But the fact is, you can be conservative and liberal at the same time, I believe it is a traditional value of Americans to see a problem of oppression in the country, and work to fix it. It may not always be fast, it may not be pretty, and at least one time, it was extremely bloody, but we have, as a nation, always worked to be better, to live up to our own ideologies. That is what we should call conservatism in the US, and it aligns with a liberal worldview."
5065,"Well, good thing the Trump administration is fighting to keep the internet free and open, then!

Oh... wait...."
5066,"On the other hand, that is stealing other people's money through taxation to have the big bad federal government intervene in the free market to produce more equitable outcomes, which is basically communism. True freedom is one corporation owning everything because the market demands it. /s"

5073,I'll point out that Ajit Pai is an Obama appointee
5074,It's usually not even that. It's more like those companies eventually get wise to the way conservative and alt right sites game the system. Just because a bunch of alt-right sockpuppet websites and accounts link back and forth to each other and get top ranks one day doesn't mean that they have any guarantees to be highly ranked tomorrow.
5075,"> There's no meaningful difference.

That's like complaining that a model of the Earth as spherical is wrong and a model of the Earth as flat is wrong, therefor there's no meaningful difference. There's a clear difference. Democrats may not be everything you want and more, but the last 25 years of politics should make it patently obvious that there are major differences in the two parties, in both style and substance."
5076,"You are talking complete bullshit.  There are plenty of differences that are plenty meaningful.  That's why while ""both sideism"" is commonly used to trivialize GOP sins, to demonize Democrats and to justify refusing to prefer Democrats  to Republicans, it's nearly never employed to trivialize Deemocrats' sins or demonize Republicans.  

If both sides were truly the same, it wouldn't be the case that both sideism nearly exclusively favors the GOP or ""opting out"" of supporting either main party altogether.  If both sides were really thee same, the rate at which saying so favors each party would be approximately equal instead of decidedly one-sided.

"
5077,"Well, until campaign finance reforms are made, we will have to try and convince corporations and their government lackeys that the policies that help the American people, will allow them to have more profit as well, because when we all do well, *we ALL do well.*"
5078,"Republican spots in the FCC are given by recommendation of republican leaders, and generally appointed regardless. Mitch McConnell recommended him. 

And you know, the whole part about Net Neutrality protections being put into place under Obama kinda undermine your attempts to place Ajit Pai as Obama's problem."
5079,"Trump appointed Pai as head of the FCC, Obama only appointed him to be a member of the FCC. Obama also appointed Pai because he had to appoint a republican and the GOP wanted Pai."
5080,Because Obama was forced to nominate a Republican.
5081,"And that wasn't great, no. But the bottom line is that, a. net neutrality was an Obama policy, and b. Pai was re-appointed by Trump."
5082,But what stopped him from making it a 3 to 2 split in favor of the democrats? Just because the Republicans have held the advantage in the past doesn't mean they need to keep it
5083,How was he forced? Did they have a gun to his head?
5084,"It was. The party in power gets 3 seats and the other gets 2. Obama didn't appoint Pai as the head of the FCC, that was Trump."
5085,Congress made him do it. It was a Republican seat.
5086,Obama actually respected many of the traditions and unwritten rules of our government instead of openly flaunting his disdain for them.
5087,"Not a gun, but the law. Of the five FCC commissioners, only three can be from the same party."
5088,"Is there a rule that says it has to be a Republican seat?
"
5089,So he could have put a non Republican up for the spot to make it 3 to 2 in favor of the Democrats?
5090,Yes. No more than 3 seats can be filled by the same party. 3 were already Dems.
5091,"Theoretically, but traditionally the opposition party determine who will be the nominees for the opposition group. This works for both parties, as it also prevents Republicans from stacking the FCC with Republicans and Republican leaning Independents. Nobody wants to break the tradition and make the commission partisan, at least to this point.

Edit: I misread your earlier post. The FCC under Obama was 3-2 in favor of Democrats. Sorry."

The things people are afraid of

Fed raising rates to cool off the economy 

The economy is in a bubble fueled by corporations buying back their own stock, the bubble pops when they run out of the tax savings. 

Even though the stock market is going up,  the tax reductions make layoffs even more appealing, causing the job cuts we now see. 

Jobs are created by demand, corporate tax cuts have one of the worst economic multiplier rates, if stimulus was the goal, there were better ways

Job rate has slowed

QE and rising income inequality "

5104,Trump doesn't even have his own budget yet. It takes a while to stop a train and reverse it's direction. I hope it doesn't happen but it appears as if we are doing everything possible to make it happen. We're balking at trade deals. Our world standing is falling. State department is falling apart.  We can't get people healthcare. We just ballooned the fuck outta the deficit. We're piling in unqualified judges. The swamp is bigger than ever. The country is more divided than ever. We're removing all the regulations that prevent a repeat of our previous financial disaster. Fuck I'm just gonna stop cause this is depressing me.
5105,say it with me: the economy and the stock market are not the same thing
5106,They only made the bubble bigger and delayed the pop until after 2018 to leave it in the democrat' s hands. I don't think he's going to get beyond 2020 without a recession though.

5121,"If Clinton did as little as Trump did in his first year, then yeah that would be correct. But instead he raised taxes on the wealthy, fought for budget spending on things that benefit all Americans and the end result was one of the longest economic expansions of the US in modern history. He actually had economic vision that helped America and not just his wealthy cronies.

But if you'd rather be a simpleton and deliberately misinterpret what I said, I can't really stop you. "

5123,"Trump lowered taxes on everyone. Again, misinterpreting the difference between Clinton and Trump. I never advocated against lowering taxes for those that need it. And the wealthy do not need lower taxes as Clinton proved. 

It sure would be nice if you debated in good faith instead of assuming my position on things, but as you called yourself, you're just a simpleton that deliberately misinterprets things. You don't have to be, it's your prerogative, but it's a shame you choose to do so. "

1. Call out your friends when they say racist things or support other racist people or policies.  Don't stay silent.  If they don't change their ways, change friends. Personally I've left a few friends because of this.
2. Vote more people of color and other minorities into office.
3. Make more friends who are from minority populations...but do so as a student trying to learn about their perspectives.  Don't ask them to be representatives of their population...simply get to know about them, their lives and the issues they are faced with. 
4. Don't consider your accomplishments as yours alone.  They are achieved with the help of a deeply racist culture that has been organized specifically for your benefit. The amount of people who are smarter, more capable, and harder workers than you but simply didn't have the backup of an entire culture and thus were not able or were not even aware of the possibilities is exceptionally high.

They will probably also utilize CDN's and software (not unlike what Cloudflare and Akamai utilize) to more extensively limit free speech and block all actual news reporting while creating virtual firewalls around any device or machine that connects to Facebook, so even when you aren't accessing Facebook's servers you're still ""under their control.""

Nothing I've seen since indicates otherwise.

The Trump campaign is overflowing with political noobs and youngins' looking to cash in and/or make a name for themselves which is a big reason why this administration is so sloppy.

Bannon may not have realized what Wolff was actually not a huge fan of Trump so things he said would later be used against him to ruin his career.

Bannon strikes me as someone that is willing to keep things on the edge of what is ""legal"" and maintain a plan for escape. So it's really not surprising that he would testify, his career is ruined and really has no where else to go. The alt-right has turned on him, the left won't accept him and the last place he'd probably want to be is behind bars. I'm thinking his goal is to turn against Trump and try and redeem himself among the alt-right by suggesting that Trump wasn't alt-right enough and perhaps make a run for president in the future."

It does? How?

Also, did you see the ""test"" that was administered to him? While I'm glad he can tell the time and knows a zebra from a hippo, that doesn't change the fact that he's still half a tweet away from triggering a nuke war with North Korea and whomever else wants to join the fray once the first few are lobbed.

5453,"From the CNN article:

> [The doctor] added that having observed Trump closely over the past year-plus, he felt no need to do any sort of cognitive testing but did so at the request of the President. Trump scored 30/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment administered by Jackson; ""I can reliably say ... if he had some type of mental, cognitive issues ... he would not have gotten 30/30 on the test,"" Jackson said.

It certainly doesn't test for any psychological disorders that don't I'm pair your cognitive abilities. 

It just demonstrates that his brain isn't a puddle of jelly. 

Saying he's not crazy is quite a stretch. No such analysis of him has been done that we know of.

Still going with this lie I see?

>The 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 236 pounds (107 kilograms), and his body mass index, or BMI, of 29.5 put him in the category of being overweight for his height.

This is also bullshit. He does not weigh 236 lbs."
5476,"If you can't trust Dr. Ronnie, who can you trust?"
5477,Quadruple Coronary noon tomorrow.
5478,The physical exam will be released on Tuesday. Expect it to be much shorter than Obama's physical exams because Trump will likely prevent anything negative from being released.
5479,"> Trump has said he gets most of his exercise playing golf. The American Heart Association has said the best types of exercise increase the heart rate and make a person breathe heavily, but that activities like golf don’t provide as much cardiovascular benefit since they don’t require much extra effort. The association suggests players walk the golf course instead of renting a golf cart. Trump drives a cart from hole to hole.

> Trump likes fast food, too, along with well-done steaks, chocolate cake and double scoops of vanilla ice cream. He reportedly downs 12 Diet Cokes a day. In their recent book, “Let Trump Be Trump,” former top campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie described the four major food groups on Trump’s campaign plane as “McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza and Diet Coke.”"

5485,"107kg puts him at a BMI of 29.5, which is still merely ""overweight"", but 108kg would push him up to 29.75, which it's difficult to justify not rounding up to 30, which is the official cutoff for being obese. 109kg would make him unquestionably obese, even if you round down. What a coincidence that he made it barely under!"
5486,You'd think they would at least bother to spell Dr. Ronny's  name correctly.
5487,One can hope. 
5488,"They're clearly lying about trump's weight and height in the readout, so I trust nothing else they release either."

5490,"When the syndicated mob family tells you to give a good bill of health for the trumplethinskin, you give a good bill of health.

5491,I was thinking this as well that the weight number was to manipulate the BMI number.
5492,That sounds like something a smart guy would say.  LIBERAL COLLEGE BOY GET HIM!
5493,"The doctor is legitimate, but the information can only be released with Donald Trump's permission. That means that he could choose to release some parts and keep other parts confidential.

That means that the information we do receive should be correct, but incomplete."
5494,"I misread the article. The weight of 236 was from the 2016 letter that also called trump the healthiest person to ever run for president. It'll be interesting to see what if any details they choose to release. A year of constant junk food, no exercise and high stress can't have been good on trump."
5495,"Does golfing multiple times a week constitute exercise? The doctor will depend on Trump's own account of his diet and activities.

Obama's diet was criticized in one of his physical evaluations, which led to Gibbs mentioning that Obama needed to exercise presidential restraint and start avoiding desserts. #funfact"
5496,">no exercise

Whoa whoa whoa, he's playing lots of golf!"
5497,"> Does golfing multiple times a week constitute exercise?

Not when you sit your fat ass in a golf cart the whole time, even to the point of committing a cardinal sin and driving the cart on the greens instead of walking a few yards. Trump even took a golf cart for that few-hundred-yards walk with European leaders last year, when the rest of them all strolled.

He's grossly unfit, and the tiny amount of exercise he gets from swinging a golf club doesn't even begin to make up for his bad habits."

If nothing else: if Trump was the genius he claims to be, he would realize that being President means that every statement and word expressed will be put under scrutiny.

Another third are completely racist and true if you trust the individual 3rd party sources, and the final third is stuff that is completely true and completely racist, but Trump didn't preface said actions with, ""What I am about to do is racist."" As such, The final third of things on the list might possibly be motivated by some other form of hatred. Sexism? Ableism? Classism? General ignorance? The report says the New York Times should have done better reporting and not included the statements or actions that are only probably racist because they can't read minds because they're stupid.

That’s how you determine whether or not he’s a  racist. See, somebody who didn’t do those things, they *might* be a racist but we’d never know. And it might well not matter. It’s okay to think things that are as racist as you like. What you say and do is what matters.

What's the purpose behind that? What is your intent on sending out this article? He's done this shit for decades. 
We don't need a periscope view from a right wing publication giving strokes of gray to the racism that is Trump. We need supporters to say, ""You know what?

Once, Democrats finally begrudgingly relent and agree to funding for the wall in exchange for other immigration reforms, then Republicans can feel like they got a big win.

5922,I’m over the wall. Peoples lives are more important. Obviously I’d prefer no wall but the truth is Dems aren’t in a position to stop it. And it’s not like the money spent will simply disappear - it’ll be spent on American business and contractors and flow back through the economy.

Take the deal."

5925,Nobody but Trump could pull off comprehensive immigration reform in 3 weeks.
5926,Good 
5927,"Most of the DACA people will be deported anyway with this.

It requires 10 to 12 years of no crime and no crime before the bill, which includes fraud. Most of them have already committed fraud in one form or another to work or apply for government services.

So we get the wall, merit based immigration and no more Visa lottery.

We will take that deal for less than 100,000 people actually getting to stay lol"
5928,"Is that the spin I'm forced to use now? To defend the caving of liberals on a worthless wall that Mexico was going to pay for? Now I have to waste more money on lawyers because the moderate Dems backed down on the shutd...oh no, they got the GOP to give in to CHIP...like getting a fat kid to give in and accept the ice cream."
5929,I had understood it was $25b in a trust fund that a future Congress couldn't undo--that's the issue.
5930,"fuck that. mexico pays for that, or trump is founded on pure lies.

If the shutdown and hostage taking is rewarded, we suffer more than the loss of dreamers, if we fail to eliminate these republicans soon."
5931,"as far as I can tell, this is literally the same logic trump is using to try to justify giving dreamers amnesty. ""We'll turf it into the future in order to give ourselves more time to kill it in the cradle."" 

Don't you dare take this bullshit deal. "

Oh, that’s just the right wing wet dream. The actual bill allows for that ‘fraud’ and is built around it,

DCDA specifically states that they need a US education, and allows/required for people to be already in the government system.

You can read the bill in full, if you like, rather than repeating right wing safe space talking points.

5940,"Yeah.  Devils in the details on how a dreamer gets qualified for citizenship.  I could envision length of time in country, education, employment record, criminal record.  

Not sure how it is turfed into the future though?  Basically status quo with a path to citizenship.

Are you concerned that it could get repealed down the line?"
5941,"DEMS don't have the votes to pass this.  
Trump only has veto power.
How do you get DACA passed?"
5942,"Put them in the same bill. If he deports people that he legally can't, that's another impeachment charge.

It takes courage and sacrifice to stand up for health care for the poor, amnesty for the innocent immigrants, and telling a tyrant that his bullshit campaign rhetoric doesn't fly. 

But keep telling yourself the shutdown was a win."
5946,They are saying something like 10 or 12 years - that's a pretty long time. I have trust issues they'd hold up their end of the bargain.
5947,"trump said something along the lines of ""we'll do an immigration deal and eventually it will sorta morph into a pathway to citizenship"" , he claims it will happen ""some time in the future"" and he said something about it taking 10-12 years. Thats a flimsy set of details , but it is already enough for me to decide for myself that it fits trumps wishy washy  pattern of ""looking like he'll do something but does the opposite or nothing"" , remember the guy stands by nothing.  I don't think the deal would get repealed down the line because I dont think trump or republicans will hold up their end of ANY deal on immigration."

5951,"Democrats have been fighting for Universal Health Care for at least 30 years, what are you talking about?"
5952,"That's right, but it's a starting point.  You can negotiate a fast track for some based on criteria.
Another admin could make amendments to shorten that period in the future.  
It's a bird in the hand.
Repealing in the next 4 to 8 years doesn't sound like good politics.



"
5953,"Trump isn't capable of creating complex solutions or holding the same view for any period of time.

In principle this isn't bad.

The problem is not entirely Trump though.  The fight will be with Paul Ryan and the REPS."
5954,"Seems to me that was similar to the deal Schumer had last Friday.  Of course Trump denied it on Tuesday.  If the deal goes thru then  Trump will say he turned down 18 b and got 25b because he is such a great negotiater.

The only thing Trump cares about his himself, tax cuts and the stupid wall.

There are many that would prefer to see no money for the wall.  His base never want DACA kids to get citizenship.

5955,"If the deal requires two bills, then yeah, definitely don't take that deal. That's a shitty deal."
5956,"I was specifically talking about CHIP. I'm going to let you stand by that broken down Hillary and you can wait for a tow truck. I, and my state will fight the here and now while you contemplate the past."
5957,"I aggree that his playbook is limited, but so far he has only really played the ""crap out on every promise"" move. so I assume this is more of that for exactly the fact that he ISNT capable of complex solutions, which is why he will always go back to ""refuse to pay when the bill comes due"" . the simplest thing for him is to say everything and fulfill nothing (that he doesn't want to do)"

My argument is the wall for DACA is a fair trade.
Trumps base will go berserk if this happens and that would be well worth it because we all know the wall is a dumb idea.  
"
5961,"Uh...it's 2018 and Hillary is irrelevant. Trump is president and Dems aren't getting it done. I would love to have Hillary as president, but it's a moot point. Shake it off and start dealing with reality!"
5962,"Are you real? I'm an adult with my own house, an education, and a job that contributes to the world (i.e; not an app developer). I don't live in a red state and if I did, I damn sure wouldn't cower to the racists in my family or my community.

5963,"no I think we have different points, but your reasons are simmilar to my reasons

Buuut . no the wall isnt a fair trade for anything.  there is nothing fair about the wall or using daca as a  weapon t make it happen, and yo, the wall is not supposed to be paid by americans and why is it suddenly cool and a fair trade that we do so?

this article this morning basically sums up my distrust of trumps ""wall and immigration plans"" .
https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43q9kd/trumps-citizenship-plan-for-dreamers-would-slash-legal-immigration"
5964,"> Uh...it's 2018 and Hillary is irrelevant.

 You brought her up specifically.


"
5965,"Thanks, Salon had a similar article this morning.  My read on your article and Salons article is about immigration reform.
Immigration reform is a separate issue.
I was never talking about immigration reform, just DACA and border security.  That is what McConnell said he would bring to the floor.
If immigration reform cannot be unlinked then you have another shutdown I suppose."
5966,You need to let go.
5967,"my point is that his ""immigration reform"" makes things better for DACA recipients, but worse for other immigrants, it's just a bait and switch package, and it is not a separate issue in trumps mind so I dont see a point in treating it as a separate issue here. Trump wants his nationalist immigration policies in exchange for Daca, which is only at threat because trump put it in that spot. daca , the wall , and trumps sham immigration reform ideas are ideologically separate issues but politically very linked right now."
5968,"In other words, Trump extorts Dreamers for a useless wall that he promised would be paid for by Mexico.
"
5969,You mean he offered it for sale for $25 billion.
5970,">But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to Republicans, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with Mexico that Trump made one of his major campaign promises.


So he's lumping in kids who were brought here against there will , with legal immigration... Dreamers need to be taken care of regardless . Why is family sponsorship or immigrants even being talked about when dreamers are brought up its so stupid . How does that logic work .."
5971,Only if the curbs are retroactive...
5972,">Why is family sponsorship or immigrants even being talked about when dreamers are brought up its so stupid . How does that logic work ..

Democrats like bringing in families of illegal immigrants. Republicans think having to waiting in a long line means people in the line should take priority.

The specific reason it comes up, is that ""dreamers"" are illegal immigrants who didn't wait in line, and in fact, cheated and cut the line, sneaking in infront of all those people in line.

If dreamers become legal immigrants through the path to citizenship, they cut in line successfully. Is it fair, ask the republicans, that those cheaters who just won amnesty now get to steal citizenship from those in line, and that it should go to the families of illegal immigrants who cheated and got amnesty? It's pretty far from fair if you think about it.

Who deserves legal immigrant status more than those who waited in line and did the process legally?"
5973,"No he didn't.

>""I don't want to be involved with these people. If you're telling me they're horrible racist people. I certainly apologize.""

Meaning: Trump won't apologize. "
5974,"In his half assed I never really apologize way, ""If you’re telling me they’re horrible racist people, I certainly apologize""."
5975,Pretty sure he did a lot more to strain his relationship with the UK.

5981,He’s finally pivoting to the center. 
5982,"Rare, but short lived. This man will never apologize to the American people.  "
5983,"People still complaining in the comments, Trump is so hated that he has the populace blinded by his efforts ignored. Trump could turn into a progressive tomorrow and people will still want him out of office. It's all understandable and overall human nature."
5984,"The rest of the world is George Costanza on this one. ""Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Donald. I don't want to get into a big thing
here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an
apology."""
5985,"3 days from now, Trump tweets about how he never apologized. "
5986,"hey man if he apologizes for at least one of those things, i still think thats a positive step forward"
5987,"Uh, but the sentiment is that he's anti-Radical Islam... why does he need to apologize for that sentiment?

"
5988,[deleted]
5989,He hasn't apologised yet.

This was the wrong move, especially for someone claiming to be carrying the mantle of feminism through the depths of American Politics. 

To be clear, I don't think this makes her a bad person, in and of itself. We all make mistakes, we all put our faith in the wrong person from time to time.

Hillary Clinton praises exiting Planned Parenthood leader
© Getty Images

Hillary Clinton on Friday praised outgoing Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards on Twitter, thanking her for her “tireless advocacy.”

“Thank you, Cecile Richards, for your tireless advocacy on behalf of women and girls, and for your grace under pressure over these last 12 years,” Clinton tweeted. “And thank you to Planned Parenthood for all you’ve done and continue to do to advance reproductive rights. Onward!”

Richards announced earlier this week that she would step down from her post after more than a decade at the helm of the organization.""

Thank you! And thank you HRC!
"
6228,"Please Hillary just go away so the democrats have a chance of saving the country. Have a life, but stay out of the public eye. You are not the comeback kid. "
6229,"Damage control, playing it smart knowing if she praises a progressive any wrong that she's done is quickly ignored. Same tactic works on Trump Supporters whenever a Republican does it, difference is that Trump Supporters are less immune to it."

6235,He said *please*.
6236,"It's not about her running for anything, she's spoken on behalf of Democrats on many occasions, this is all about people refusing to condemn her for protecting someone who engages in sexual assault. How can she claim to be for women when she's covering up crimes? We can't keep calling out Trump when we refuse to call out our own."
6237,Whoever that true feminist may be they are playing it smart. Hillary Clinton's name is thrown around so much people get really touchy when it comes to any criticism of her. That feminist will be denounced instead as a Trump Sympathizer.
6238,Because it's a distraction from the real issue of the Trump collusion and obstruction of justice.
6239,Trump Supporters will use this as a distraction but what happens to the victim of sexual assault that Hillary Clinton decided to ignore? Condemning Hillary Clinton won't distract it will show we are consistent and aren't just going after Republicans and ignoring wrongdoings on our side. Everyone needs to be held accountable if they are guilty no matter party affiliation. Sexual Assault shouldn't even be partisan.

6242,"Look at his posting history, it's like he's trying to singlehandedly move the Overton Window to the Left. I don't think he actually cares about the facts of this specific case, he just thinks that any named and powerful Democrat is evil because they aren't liberal enough."

6244,">The Republican tax plan was signed into law just last month, and Democrats already have a well-worn, and misleading, talking point about it: 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent.

> That’s true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then.

Well alright then."
6245,">In 2018, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of income earners would glean 20.5 percent of the tax cut benefits — a sizable chunk, but far less than the figure that’s preferred by Democrats. And in 2025, that percentage would be 25.3 percent, with the top 1 percent (those earning above $837,800) getting an average tax cut of $61,090.

>Just two years later, in 2027, the percentage of tax benefits to this income group jumps to 82.8 percent, “because almost all individual income tax provisions would sunset after 2025,”

The press release they link to gives the context very clearly. "
6248,"> Why do these individual tax cuts expire in the law? Republicans say they expect a future Congress will extend those cuts, rather than allowing taxes for many to increase. But in order to pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Nor could they have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window."
6249,"But don’t forget, that will be magically fixed in the future so you don’t have to ever think of what is actually going to happen and only need to think about what the republicans tell you they believe will happen in the future. "
6250,Ironically the only time Republicans bring up the truth it's only to say that it's all lies. You know something is probably true when a Republican denies that it's true. 
6251,"Yes, the republicans made a promise to do something in 9 years that would make the democrats claim untrue.

Let me know how that works out.

Until then, we'll just have to judge the claim by its merits based on the actual law."
6252,Brb going to bang my dick in a car door. 
6253,Less a promise and more a political likelihood. Neither party wants to be seen as one that let taxes rise on ordinary folks.

Of course everyone still gets an equal vote in general elections and you can chose your candidate (whoever DNC chooses as its nominee for president for example). Plus the primary process offers no real choice either as we’ve seen. DNC was wrong to make it appear as if they weren’t favoring a candidate when in fact they were.

6396,"I don't know how much the DNC pushed their thumbs on the scale or if they did at all. It was more a typical exercise in machine politics and favor trading for most of the established democratic names.

And here it wasn't so much bias against Sanders; That's understandable, since he wasn't even a Democrat and crashed the party so that was bound to rub a lot of people the wrong way. It was just that Clinton had a clear path with no opposition from any high profile people *in* the party. No one with a name ran against her except Sanders, which is why he gained so much momentum. 

You didn't have a second run by Dean or Kerry or a run by a prominent Governor. The only people that bothered had no political connections with Clinton and had no names. You had the guy that killed a man, the guy who said all lives matter, the guy who just got over his dad dying, *Hillary fucking Clinton* mic drop, and holy shit a self proclaimed socialist!

DNC didn't have to do shit. Maybe they leaned on the process and maybe not, but they didn't have to. It was about who didn't run.

And then second Donna Brazile (acting DNC chair for a significant enough time in 2016) came out with a tell all book where she writes about the moment she realized the election was rigged against Bernie. She says she was heartbroken for him. That it can’t happen again. 

Now again I have no idea these two could be full of it but it seems like they probably know what they are talking about.

Above is the link to a Washington post article discussing how both individuals now concede the DNC primary was rigged. 

Note as well I voted for Hillary. DNC thought and I agree still despite the general election results that Hillary gave Dems the best chance to win. She won fair and square speaking strictly in terms of votes — no one is saying the votes were rigged. Just the funding and the resources were heavily in Hillary’s favor and the DNC never gave Bernie an equal pathway to the nomination. 

They don’t have too either. But unethical to lie and give off the image it was a fair primary process and both candidates could come out on top. Thousands of people gave their time to work on Bernie’s campaign. Thousands gave money too — many small donations these are rich billionaires. And I would assume they would not have if they had known he had no chance to win. Same with the people giving their time. "
6405,I agree 
6406,[deleted]
6407,"Again as I mentioned, I voted for Hillary, I do not think the DNC favoring Hillary over Him robbed him of a victory. 

It is a different issue though whether he is truly a “democrat” and whether he should have even been allowed to enter the primary. DNC let him enter though and made it seem like they were going to give him an equal shot. It seems that he did not in fact have one. 

Now to where you mention the op-ed - the Washington Post here appears to be quoting an op-ed Brazile did prior to the release of her book. I didn’t read the book (might now) but just looking at the chapter titles quick it’s clear she devotes a lot of time to talking about it. It just isn’t logical why she would lie that it was rigged if it wasn’t. She was the DNC acting chair, it makes her look really bad. Then again, Hillary lost. She might see her time as a top DNC figure as gone-also she’s booted from CNN. So she could have pushed out this book to cash in one more time while she’s still especially relevant and in the public eye. 

Warren said it was rigged. But then you have to remember she might run herself in 2020 and want to ensure that it is a fair process for herself when the time comes. 

I have no idea honestly. I just know that a top Democratic Senator and literally the then acting chair of the DNC agree that it was rigged. And they obviously have much more info and access then I do. I also don’t have the motivation to really look into it given that Hillary still lost and we have Trump in the White House. Who I absolutely can’t stand and I am guessing you can’t either. 

Last point but I agree too that Hillary- a former Sec of State, Senator, First Lady list goes on should be treated differently than Bernie who is a self proclaimed socialist. He previously didn’t even want to identify as a Democrat but rather an Independent. 

Praying for a Biden-Booker or Biden-Harris ticket to save the DNC and get Trump out in 2020. Bernie if he runs again will just bring more problems again..

6695,"Yeah... huge companies don't make such decisions within two weeks of a tax plan that isn't even implemented yet.

These were planned a year ago, at least."
6696,"of those 167 companies listed, I find 47 that increased wages, of that 7, the wage was an increase to match minimum wage (which I think they'd have to do anyway--someone correct me if I'm wrong on that).

As you read through this list, can anyone confirm, deny or comment on:

* If these thing had to have been planned in advance or if this is a direct cause?
*  I haven't included 401k matches or increase to minimum wage because I'm not sure if those things are required in a new year for corporations, can anyone let me know that info?

will edit this as I go:

The good:

1. 1st Summit Bank: $1k bonuses to full-time employees; salary raises; increased charitable donations

2. Apple (AAPL): $2,500 bonuses in restricted stock units, hiring 20,000 new employees

3. BancorpSouth Bank: pay raises for ~70% of employees, bonuses for ~20% of employees

4. IAT Insurance Group: $3k bonuses for 685 non-executive employees(big number of bonus so it goes into the good pile, still not a raise.)

5. JPMorgan (JPM): 22,000 employees will get base wage raised from $12-$16.50 up to $15-$18, opening up 400 new branches, hiring 4,000 new employees (best one so far. Amazeballs really but considering the stockmarket is killing it, not surprising. Excellent that their success is transferring to their employees which has not been the case in most of this tax break)

6. Kalb Industries of Nevada: Pay raises for employees who have been with the company for 3+ months (maybe should be in the meh because no clue what the pay raise is, if it's just to minimum wage,  then I'm not including it)

7. M&T Bank Corporation (MTB): Base wage raised to $14/$16 (based on location), employees receive 40 hours of paid time annually for volunteer activities (putting this in the good cuz I like the volunteer time =P)

8. Meridian Bancorp (EBSB): Base wage raised to $15, additional 20% added to exiting bonuses, **six new branch locations** (bolded good part, rest is meh)

9. MusicNotes: 3% salary increase for all 55 employees (whelp, this is the 2nd best one so far)

10. Nexus Services: 5% raise for all employees, hiring 200 more workers in 2018 (this goes to number 2 best one so far. This is good news)

11. United Bank & Trust: Salaries & hourly employees receive raise of $100/month




The meh:

1. American Community Bank & Trust: $500 bonuses to all employees, hiring more employees (no numbers on hires, could be 2 could be 100? *shrug*)

2. Bank of the James: Increase base wage to $15 for employees serving more than 1 year; increased employee vacation days

3. ES Bancshares: $500 bonuses to non-executive full-time employees, $250 bonuses to part-time employees, creating 10 new jobs (a whole 10 woo)

not sure:

1. Boeing (BA): $300 million for “workplace of the future” facilities, infrastructure, workforce development, charitable giving

2. Canary LLC: Hire more employees (no clue how many)

3. FireBird Bronze: Offering health insurance to its nine employees for first time, upgrading equipment, hiring

4. Royal Hawaiian Heritage Jewelry: Open more stores, hire more employees (not sure how many jobs this would bring and how many stores tehy'[re opening).

5. Washington Federal: Provide 5% increase in addition to normal merit increase for employees earning <$100k; invest in employee training programs

6. White Pine Winery: Planting more vines

bad:

NexTier Bank: $1k bonuses for all employees, tuition reimbursement on job training (wtf would you EVER not pay your employees for job training???)

Walmart: Increase starting wage to $11; expand maternity and paternal leave benefits; one-time cash bonus for eligible associates of up to $1k ( goes under bad becaue they paid for this by laying off a ton of workers and closing stores)

edit:Okay I'm done with the list and the rest of the companys on that list are bonuses and a few with minimum wage hikes which I believe are required so they'r enot lincluded. Bonuses are not wage increases. What are people gonna do next year when they don't get a bonus""?

6697,"The thumbnail is Wal-Mart, which is ironic since they coincidentally announced their ""bonuses"" and wage increase at the same time they quietly laid off thousands."
6698,Most are just one time bonuses with zero commitment to raising wages. We are getting pennies on the dollar with Trump’s tax cuts. Another example of his shit business sense.

What happens when DACA passes in the senate but it doesn't move forward in the house?  how can the democratic senators then shutdown the government based on what's happening (or not happening) in another completely different chamber.

They get to shut the government down again for emphasis. Then they can keep doing it all the way to the midterms. Perfect wedge issue. The people support it, the hard right oppose it, trump will be on the wrong side every time. "

Chip was in the friday bill that the democrats voted no on (and yes I know some Republicans vote no as well).

6728,"Not everyone wanted CHIP. It had no funding. There was no money for CHIP until today’s bill. There was no agreement to bring DACA to the Senate floor until today. There was no short-term continuation (rather than the Republican 9-month version) until today, which preserves Democrat leverage. What did Republicans get today?"
6729,Exactly how is he fucked if he doesn’t move on the DACA deal?
6730,He may also be fucked with his  xenophobes if he makes a deal on DACA that does not include mass deportation of Dreamers.
6731,I think you misunderstand. CHIP was a bargaining piece for republicans during this round. This takes that away for 6 years. They can't hold children's health insurance against dems anymore for the next round in 3 weeks.
6732,"Slight amendment to your statement:

The Only promise is that we talk about DACA every minute of every hour for the next three weeks.

The Dems got CHIP and put Mitch in a snare. The ball falls to us folks on the ground. This is where we need to keep stories about DACA recipients in the headlines, in local press and spamming inboxes, twitter feeds everywhere. There needs to be daily calls to Senators saying you support them and DACA and, if you have connections to red states, let those politicians know that if they don't support DACA, they lose your tourist or industry $.

This is a 2 prong assault. They legislate and we pressure on the ground."
6733,Have fun with that existential crisis that comes for you in November.
6734,"We got to help CHIP, and get to talk DACA which has bipartisan support. What leverage does the GOP have now? Killing old people?"
6735,"CNN isn't the left's biggest cheerleader, but the politics as sports analogy is apt. CNN is more like the Don King of political reporting.

You know who really won today? The children and families who receive CHIP benefits. You're right, Republicans should never have held children's benefits hostage as if it's some kind of game."
6736,"*complains about not wanting CNN to get ad revenue while posting an article from CNN*

What a stable genius we have here."
6737,"Chris Cilizza isn't the lefts biggest cheerleader. He's thinks he's a sports broadcaster or entertainment reporter, always hovering who wins and loses and who looks good and who looks bad. Search his articles and tweets and see how many times he's said ""this is the best speech Trump has given so far."" He's a dipshit and nobody takes him seriously."

6741,"CHIP funding was offered in Friday's CR, prior to the shutdown.  CHIP had absolutely nothing...and I mean nothing to do with the shutdown.  We basically accepted the same deal that was offered Friday, with a little time knocked off.  Honestly, anyone that thinks we won anything here is lying to themselves.

We said there would be no CR without a DACA fix.  A little over two days later, we caved."
6742,"Like the Republicans were going to cut healthcare from 6 million kids in an election year that looks like trouble for them.

Please.  Be realistic.

"
6743,">What did Republicans get today?

Articles and pundits on the left claiming that the democrats lost this. Pundits on MSNBC saying that democrats are good at saying what they believe in, but aren't good at going through with it.

It doesn't matter if it's true or not. The Republicans took the heat off themselves by having democrats fight one another."
6744,"He gets another shutdown, in 2 weeks. "
6745,"Because then Dems can shut down the government again in February and say it's because McConnell reneged on his deal. That's hours of campaign material, how the GOP is acting in extremely bad faith."
6746,"DACA for full funding on the wall, ending the lottery program (switching to merit based), and curbing chain migration. That has always been the deal and that will remain the deal, otherwise no DACA. "
6747,"I didn't misunderstand.

the 6 years of CHIP was in the friday bill.

The democrats chose to shut down the government instead.

Therefore basis logic 101 is that by voting for basically the same bill on monday one can not claim that the shutdown won them 6 years of chip as that was already won before the shutdown."
6748,"Yes i agree that a good PR blitz can make the difference, I just don’t find it likely."
6749,LOL! Where do you get your news? The CHIP money is not a new addition in todays deal. It was in the bill that failed on Friday. What changed?
6750,I appreciate you agreeing with the sad 'game' analogy but I really do not understand what you are talking about otherwise. The Chip funding was in Friday's bill. Nothing changed on that front. So isn't it the democrats that held children's benefits hostage as if it's some kind of game? I would love to hear how you could possibly twist it otherwise - when 48 out of 51 Republican senators voted to pass the bill with Chip funding last friday.
6751,"Well, “a little time knocked off” means the next battle begins in 17 days rather than after the Mid-Term elections. The Dems have CHIP off the table and DACA has 17 days of spotlight until the government shuts down again. To me, that’s an interesting piece of leverage the Dems created out of nothing. "
6752,"President Obama went through eight years of apparently losing every single political battle in these post mortem media narratives. And yet, after losing every battle, Obama achieved considerable long-term shifts in American life. Republicans won every battle and lost the war. In short, I don’t trust the short-term media narrative on political matters. "
6753,"The general public probably isn’t going to have the patience for many more shut downs, regardless of who is to blame. When McConnell is known to lie in order to get bills passed, I don’t know if “but McConnell promised” will bring people around. It’s sort of a “fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me” situation. Either way, they seemed to have public support for this shutdown, so why risk it? Either take the deal and don’t do the shut down, or hold out for something tangible. They held out for a promise that, if broken, might be used for leverage to maybe justify another shut down. But here’s the thing, they can fulfill the promise, bring up a bill in the Senate and just vote it down in the senate, house, or Trump could veto. So now they’ve fulfilled the promise, and no more leverage and no more DACA. Now was the time to push. They bought a winning lottery ticket and spent it on another lottery ticket. I hope we win on the next ticket, but I sorta wish we had paid the bills with the winnings."
6754,"Oh really?

Now the Democrats are going to just shut down the government every 2 weeks for kicks?"
6755,"Which will make every single federal employee realize that Democrats aren't serious.  If they were, they would have done something today instead of just fucking with us on the basis of a three week promise. "
6756,"This is why I feel like GOP has the upper hand here.  They can put a full solution for DACA into an actual immigration reform bill, and then make it look like Democrats don't care about DACA if they won't accept it.    This is why John Kelly is also telling Trump not to accept any deal for ""just the wall."" 

I am interested to see what they come up with.  I don't really care much provided they come up with a solution for DACA,  that is what is important here, as these people have been here since childhood.

My prediction is: An immigration bill that has a bunch of stuff, and a fix for DACA, but is not a path to citizenship for DACA, only permanent residency.    And then, the Democrats get them to give them a path to citizenship in exchange for the rest of their stuff.

"
6757,Good luck! We’re all counting on you!
6758,">The democrats chose to shut down the government instead.

Wait, how was that the democrats choice?  I thought republicans had a majority.  If anyone chose to shut down the government, it was the Republicans, who couldn't figure out a bill that enough of their own party wanted to stand behind."
6759,I'm honestly think I'm being trolled by people in these threads claiming the shutdown won CHIP. It's mind boggling.
6760,In politics sometimes a show of force needs to be used to prove to your opponent that you are serious. Dems showed they were serious and weren't going to let DACA go. It told the turtle that it's an issue that isn't going to be let go next time.
6761,"This has been quite a talking point for a lot of accounts. The DACA negotiations were not in Friday's deal. It's now on the Repubs to get all their warring factions together and see if they can govern by coming up with something, anything, they all endorse as a starting point. If they can't, they are incompetent and they cause a shut down. If they wont, they are dealing in bad faith, and they cause a shutdown. Either way, they use sick kids as hostages anymore. "
6762,"CHIP is now funded, after having been delayed for months. It can't be held hostage and disingenuously demagogued in three weeks. If DACA is not resolved in that time, we get a another shutdown with less distracting noise on peripheral issues. "
6763,"The promise of a vote on DACA, the removal of the Republicans' bargaining CHIP, and the fact that if they renege on their promise, we shut down again in 3 weeks. 

That's a pretty solid bargaining position. Much stronger than where the Democrats were on Friday. "
6764,"Republicans wanted stuff, and somehow still hadn't managed to re-pass CHIP, after *they killed it, several months ago.*

The (literal) hostage takers have just been robbed of a hostage.  And let me turn it around - what did the *republicans* get out of it?  They have one less hostage, and have promised to deal with DACA, meaning that if they don't, they'll find themselves in the *exact same situation* in just 3 weeks.  Except with one less hostage to hold over everyone's heads.

Oh, and we also got some prime footage of Mitch McConnell blocking soldier pay out of the deal.

Yeah, I don't think Repubs came out ahead on this one..."
6765,Just cause you don't have the skill do figure it out doesn't mean it didn't happen xD
6766,"Why did a Republican-majority Congress allow CHIP to expire in October? Considering the program serves nearly 9 million children and the CBO has calculated that funding CHIP will save billions of dollars, it seems like a no-brainer. Why did it take over 100 days to fund a successful program and why did it have to be tied to the continuing resolution?"
6767,"Couldn't you just as easily say that those 3 republican votes that wouldn't go for it were the ones holding the government hostage?

Why do you immediately blame the democrats, when they don't even have a majority?"
6768,"No it doesn't begin in 17 days.

If the Democrats try and shutdown the government every 17 days, they are going to look like complete asshats.  It took them 3 days to cave this time.  I give them 3 hours next time.

Our leaders are complete embarrassments to any sensible person."
6769,"We have no leverage.  We stated unequivocally that there would be no CR without a DACA fix.  60 hours later, we completely folded and demonstrated we lack the courage of our convictions.

Shit, we're not even insisting on a fix on a condition of funding anymore.  Now we just want a vote."
6770,"You understand that the underlying dynamic of a shutdown in 2 weeks won’t be any different than it was last week: The GOPs inability to pass a budget after over a year in control of everything.

"
6771,"Well, until the Republicans pass a budget.

It didn’t have to be this way, but they couldn’t get their shit together in over a year and now they have to give to get."
6772,"Good points, I agree. Much of Trump's base gets awfully upset when he starts talking about DACA, but I think they are just going to have to accept that it is the only bargaining chip Trump has to get funding for the wall and other immigration reform done. Plus it is probably the right thing to do. Personally, I support DACA (with a strong merit based path to citizenship) and I think you are seriously lacking compassion if you don't. "
6773,"A deal with CHIP was there.  Most republicans voted for it, most democrats voted against it.

It's pretty simple really.

Afterwards, the leadership of the democratic party proudly proclaimed that they worked against it."
6774,"No, they seem to actually believe it."
6775,"Two weeks of debate while the government is shutdown and you have all the leverage is better than two weeks of debate without it.  GOP is just gonna vote on a poison Daca bill and then blame dems if they do the shutdown again.  They could have negotiated the terms of daca, then reopened once a real bill was ready."
6776,"Sure, fine.  If that is the reason to claim victory then ok.

But it is simply wrong to say that the shutdown won CHIP.  It did not.

The threat of shutdown won CHIP.  CHIP was won on friday.  The dems voted to shut-down after CHIP was won.

Therefore logic 101 says the shutdown did not win CHIP.

Rather, the dems got outplayed and turned a big victory (CHIP) into a defeat by allowing the Republicans to claim that the shutdown was over DACA.

The Republicans had a simple message:  The Dems voted to shutdown over illegal aliens.

The Democrats had a complex argument:  ""well, if you look at the intricate details of months of budget negotiations....""

Simple messages beat complex messages every time.

The democrats played their hand perfectly until friday night, and then got outplayed at the end.  This is why they folded today.

Blindly supporting your own team in the face of their mistakes doesn't actually support your cause.  I am in favor of both DACA and CHIP.  Schumer got out-played friday night.

If that obvious fact is instead buried then it will just make it more likely that it will happen again in a few weeks, which, frankly, is what I think is going to happen."
6777,"60 votes required. Only 3 democrat's initially voted for the CHIP funding, so yes the majority of the blame lies on the Democrats (Schumer/Pelosi stooges). I need to look into why Rand Paul voted no. He usually has pretty good reasoning for his ideological voting. Graham and Flake are IMO Schumer/Pelosi stooges too. Surprised McStain didn't stooge out as well."
6778,"You explained it: We have no leverage. Yet, yet, now we have six years of CHIP funding, DACA legislation coming to the Senate floor, continuing resolution reduced to 17 days from 9 months. These are valuable achievements. It’s not an A+ grade, but it’s a solid B, with no leverage. "
6779,"Of course it is different.

The Democrats tried a shutdown, and caved in 3 days, and looked stupid.

Now they are going to try it again in 2 weeks.  How do you think that is going to work?"
6780,"Not anymore.

The Democrats fucked it up."
6781,"You mean when they were like [""yeah, we had reached an agreement, and then Kelly told trump to kill it""](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/20/how-trump-chief-of-staff-john-kelly-helped-to-kill-deal-to-avoid-shutdown.html)?

How again is that the democrats fault?"
6782,That wasn't the Democrats' argument at all. 
6783,"This is DACA. These people are supported by 79% of the country as should be citizens. You really think that bullshit is gonna work? It's more like R's try and the D's say ""Republicans want to kick out this white 23 year old who was brought here at 2 years old illegally."" These aren't immigrants, they're Americans, and that's how the country treats them."
6784,We were getting 6 years of CHIP funding before the shutdown....so what did we gain by demonstrating that we lack the moral courage to back up our words? (And Friday's CR was not for 9 months).
6785,We had leverage.  Until we completely fucked this up.
6786,There was no reason to not have passed a budget for 2018 in 2017 other than Republican incompetence.
6787,"You keep saying like it’s true.

If you didn’t have a completely dysfunctional Republican Party in power the Democrats would not matter."
6788,"There was a bill on the floor that fully funded the government, and included CHIP.

The Republicans mostly voted yes, The democrats mostly voted no.  That's a fact."
6789,Whats the argument then?
6790,"The devil is in the details.  79% of Americans support the idea that these 800,000 or so kids shouldn't be kicked out.  I agree.  But, we see from this last weekend that it only goes so far.  Most did not think the government should be shut down over it.

Now, so here's the thing:

The public is sold on the 800,000.  The democrats want a lot more than 800,000.  They want more like 3 million which apparently includes the parents.

So here is what the Republicans are likely to do (although the party is so fucked and Trump so crazy you never really know).

They will propose:

A.  Significant funding for the wall.
B.  Getting rid of ""chain migration"" in favor of merit based (also very popular).
C.  Allowing DACA for the ~800K or so currently enrolled.
D.  Denying the others that the democrats want to let in.

The democrats won't vote for that.

Trump and most Republicans will say ""we have agreed to let the dreamers in, and the democrats voted against them"".

Mark my words.

And, I am not endorsing this.  I am pretty liberal on immigration.  I simply believe that the democratic leadership doesn't know what it is doing and will be out-played, as they were friday night."
6791,"There was an agreement ready, and then trump scuttled it.  This is also fact.

And again.  Why are you blaming the minority party for disagreeing?  Why do you think the democrats are to blame, and not the 3 republicans who ALSO happened to think this was a dumb idea?"
6792,"""Yeah it was bad, we're staying shutdown until it's good."" There aren't a huge amount of people actually listening to the R's at this point either, I would think."
6793,"I'm not blaming anyone.  That' what you are getting wrong.

Your argument proves my point:

The democrats got outplayed:

Republicans:  The democrats shut down the government over DACA

Democrats:  Convoluted argument tracing the history of negotiations, and pointing out that a few Republicans voted with them.

Simple arguments beat complex ones every time.

To answer your questions:  It just so happens that the Repbublican party is made up of numerous different people and factions who don't see eye to eye, plus different ones are facing different electorates.

This, by the way, is the reason why some democrats voted yes.

You are assuming that I am arguing that the Republicans are ""right"".

I'm not arguing that at all. 

I am arguing that they got out-played, and if that isn't recognized they are going to get out-played again.

How about instead of cringing in fear of your opposition's voter base, you motivate your own voter base by actually giving them the policies you ran on?

If you admit a policy is possible, and your base wants it, but you don't push it because you're scared of alienating people who will *literally never vote for you in a million years* (the ""moderate Republican"" demographic Democrats yearn for, which is a *tiny* voting bloc) what purpose do you actually serve as a political party? Serious question. Cuz even this framing seems to center appeasing Republican voters over actually appeasing and energizing the base, or for that matter the giant majority of politically disengaged people who think neither corporate party represents their interest.

To me, ""smart"" politics means not compromising away your agenda when you don't absolutely need to.

Also, the Republican tax cut was unpopular because of its contents, not because of how they passed it. People hate austerity, they want more taxes on the rich. THAT'S why the tax plan is so disliked.

>You just said they had an easier option but they chose to fight for it. 

Yeah they chose to handicap themselves and reach out to compromise while fighting against an opponent that was explicitly committed to sabotaging them at all costs. Or did you not remember literally anything Mitch McConnell did? Don't give those people a fucking inch if you want to actually get shit done."

What you do now -- is start socking away money in the Treasury, paying down the debt, for when times AREN'T good.

Instead, Trump has taken 1.5 trillion out of the Treasury for a tax cut for corporations and the rich.

They are deregulating the banks again. They are defunding the Consumer Protection Bureau. They are making it harder to get health insurance, harder to get Medicaid, harder to get food stamps.

The problem is it is a shitty plan long term and only helps people who own stocks which tend to be the wealthier people.  So yes he is a huge reason the market is up so much, but that is  a shitty metric to base a strong economy on.  More importantly are things like jobs and wages which he really hasn't changed from what Obama had started before him.

TLDR:  He is good for the market and the wealthy.  Not for the poor and laborers."
6947,"The economy was on very solid footing when Trump took office, but I think it's wrong to make the assumption that the current gains have had nothing to do with him. IMO there have been two main factors. First, Wall St and most of the big companies know it's unlikely Trump and the Republicans will do anything to increase regulations on them, so that's positive for them going forward (a reduction is even more favorable, but even without one they know if they're making money now the government isn't likely to hinder them during this administration).  The second is obviously the tax cuts. There have already been a few companies pledging to bring money back on-shore, but I think the jury is still out on how the whole thing will turn out.

I also think the market is being driven by a degree of ""irrational exuberance"" right now though. The questions are, what event will trigger the correction, and how far will it go?"

Are they really more valuable?   One company I follow has seen a huge stock rise, but they've basically announced they are going to spend $750M on a stock buyback this year.   That's money that won't be spent on improving products, or modernizing factories etc.   But if you are an executive sitting on a pile of stock options, then it's the only logical play I suppose."

-Tariffs making foreign markets less eager to sell in America. 
-Other countries imposing tariffs as a screw you to Trump.
-Less aid to countries like Palestine means the families of screwed over Palestinians become radicalized and seek to harm us. 
-Low wages keeping consumers from consuming. 
-High wage earners not spending money and stashing it in foreign markets
-Higher tax burdens on the middle and poor thanks to the new tax bill leading to less spending in an already downward market. 
-Investing in bunk fossil fuel commodities that cost more then Renewable and pollute the environment. 
-Automation reducing good paying jobs. 
-A massive cut in Government revenue means a bloated deficit/debt....(Tax cuts didn't pay for themselves)
-Businesses having extra incentive to offshore high pay jobs. 
-The already massive Russia Investigation.

You wouldn't pay $100 for it, because 1) there is a real risk, and 2) you'll have different investment opportunities (buy a painting, put it in a savings account, buy stocks, etc). So you factor the value (normally expressed as a discount in %) of 1 and 2. So maybe you'd be willing to buy it for $80.

1) Obama arrested more illegals at the border than Trump does.

2) Obama deported more illegals than Trump does.

Secondly, Papadopoulos was arrested at Washington-Dulles International Airport on July 27, 2017, so to suggest that his opinion at the time of the text couldn't have changed when more information surfaced since then is a bit naive.

Critics of Nunes are saying ""This Nunes memo isn't legitimate because it's just notes that he made himself but refuses to release."" That's the same thing that critics of the Comey memos were saying when all of that first hit the news.

Now, when they try to undermine the Comey memos, they'll say ""Well, if the Nunes memos aren't good enough evidence for liberals, then why do they accept the Comey memos as evidence? Totally hypocritical and obstructionist!""

Get Americans all spun up about classified material (Imagine the outrage! The government has classified material!!), and then try to force them to release it! Dang - brilliant! It would save the FSB all kinds of time trying to cultivate assets, and get them to steal stuff etc.. Just make politicians bow to Hannity and Meadows and there we go - presto!"
7154,"In reading everything I've seen thus far about this ""memo"", it seems that releasing it would disclose classified material, and that is why the GOP is not releasing it. 

More importantly though, if there are abuses happening, and the Congress, or someone else found evidence of those abuses, then that would be referred to an Attorney General for investigation.  That would not be handled via a memo drafted by the office of Mr. Nunes. In that case, if the memo was considered evidence, it would be included in that investigation. 

To whit, the questions we should be asking are - if there were abuses, were these referred to an Attorney General for investigation. If not, why not? 

We could then also request that our respective Congressional representatives keep us posted on the progress of such an investigation.  

That is how this kind of thing is normally handled. 

Frankly, to me, something is really fishy about Mr. Nunes' memo.  His office seems to be stoking the fires about its existence, causing all this outrage because they very cynically are banking on Americans not being familiar with how the Federal government actually handles abuse of power matters. 

But, by getting the ""word out"" about such a ""memo"", Nunes can continue to thrown sand into the machinery of the the Special Counsel by continuing the drum beat against him, and degrading his credibility.

Nunes baffles me.  How is it that a member of Congress is SO concerned about what the Special Counsel is doing? The other Republicans are tossing a kernel here and there at the investigation (which is to be expected) but Nunes is going all out trying to muck up this investigation. What is that all about????"
7155,He's also recused from all matters related to the Special Counsel. What the hell is he doing?
7156,Trump could declassify it immediately.
7157,"It's so obvious, Nunes is the deep state, he's trying to operate a coup to over throw Trump.  So he has this memo that could exonerate Trump and destroy the Russia investigation, so why won't he release it immediately to show the world how innocent Trump is?  Because he's using it as leverage to seize control of the country.  And his fellow congressmen are going on Fox News taunting Trump about how awesome this memo is but revealing nothing that would help Trump.  They're the secret society!

In the sense that we all have biases, possibly. I don't know the man personally.

So yes, there was probably a whiff of bias that got Styzok kicked off the investigation. As to which text, who knows save Mueller and company. But calling Trump an idiot is probably a good start.

Calling this treasonous is overly dramatic and silly. And tin foil hat worthy.

Yet your posts are full of it. This is all most of us are doing with regard to the Mueller investigation.

None of us really do. Which is why so many of us are speculating based on the limited information we have.

It's been something McConnell has used over and over again to gain leverage. He got Flake to go along with the tax bill by saying he'd introduce DACA legislation in January. Guess what, didn't happen. Now he's using something he already promised, and failed to deliver, to once again bargain for something. 

No, he will not keep to his word.

7401,"I've got mixed feelings about this. CHIP funding is nice but McConnell didn't really promise a vote for DACA. Just that there would be a ""fair"" process for debates and amendments, only agreeing to take it to a vote if its agreed upon. Even if that is taken as a promise for a vote, it would be up to Ryan to actually approve it and bring it to the floor for a vote. So far there is no promise that Ryan will bring such a bill to a vote.

 He really didn't offer up very much. The more I look into this issue the more I am siding with Pelosi on this decision. This was too hasty and nothing was really promised. Even if it was taken as a promise, it's not one McConnell has control over. 

The up side, CHIP can't be turned into a political weapon for another 6 years and the Democrats can shut the government down again in 3 weeks if they don't get what they want.

I really hope Schumer knows what hes doing."

7405,"The GOP got nothing and the Dems got a few things - They exposed the GOP for ransoming chip and soldier's pay in exchange for a wall, they got CHIP funding (a win for all of us) and the GOP only got 3 weeks funding.

It'd be really fucking helpful if *Politico* would take the time to point out that the White House has, so far, completely and utterly failed to articulate what any kind of a ""negotiation"" would look like. If they can't accept something like the DREAM Act, then what *do* they want? No one knows! Neither the White House nor the Republican Party actually *have* any kind of coherent plan or position, but, sure, this whole story is all about Democrats."

7408,Well you knew this is how it would play out. If there's another shutdown I expect the same thing to happen.

7410,"What would any thinking person expect the Trump White House to say?

There's a new continuing resolution, and another would be needed in less than 3 weeks. This is a respite to see if McConnell can be trusted to keep his word. If McConnell does keep his word, and the Senate returns to regular order over DACA and immigration, well & good. If McConnell reneges or Ryan kills anything in the House of Representatives or POTUS vetoes anything passed by Congress, the bad press accrues to Republicans.

This wasn't immediate gratification for the left. Too damn bad. This was both players, McConnell and Schumer, making tactical adjustments. This buys 2 1/2 weeks of relative normality while still allowing Democrats to hold things up in early February of Republicans prove they won't honor their word."

Trump has been sidelined, CHIP is funded for 5 years preventing the deaths of poor children that Trump and the GOP had raging boners over, and the Republicans only got funding for a couple more weeks during which they promised to allow debate on DACA legislation. If they renege, the GOP lost on CHIP and they get another shutdown the public will know is their fault. "

7418,"If I were him, I would continue to talk trash until the Democrats pushed back. The GOP was taking the blame for the shutdown. And to end it, they didn't have to give up anything more than they offered the night before the shutdown. Which allows them to push the narrative that the Democrats were truly to blame because all they had to do was take the deal that was on the table from day one, and the deal they eventually did accept.

The Democrats misplayed this in many ways, and it is very frustrating to me. I'll be voting for them (I will take ineffective people with good policy ideas over effective people with bad policy ideas), but I am very upset with how they played this. They should have held out for more, and if what they got was enough, then they should have taken it Friday night and been the heroes that prevented the shutdown. This kind of crap is what gets democrats to stay home on election day. You have to inspire your voters and the way they handled this was uninspiring. "

7422,You seem to have forgotten that Schumer already offered funding for the wall. Literally the dumbest Trump MAGA promise and dems are delivering it for him. How is that a win?
7423,"No one should be surprised. I called this the minute Schumer started giving his fucking speech on the Senate floor. It's too obvious, and he walked right into it. There will be no DACA deal, there will be no quarter from Republicans on this. They will see this as a ""win"", and they will use to to be even more aggressive in future negotiations. McConnell and Ryan will work in lockstep to prevent any ""unsavory"" bills of this nature from coming to a vote in both chambers of Congress."
7424,Wait till they offered funding for the wall....
7425,"Of course it is, and progressives who think that Democrats would've been portrayed as heroes for holding the government's doors shut over DACA have, apparently, not paid attention for the last thirty years."

I'm fucking amazed that there are Democrats and progressives who think that Democrats would've been portrayed as conquering heroes for keeping the government closed over DACA. Americans support DACA *right up until* you ask them if they support a government shutdown over it, after which, support tanks. A prolonged shutdown would've made that worse, not better. "
7428,"Actually they've gotten plenty from this.

Republicans cannot use shutdown for political gain since it only went on for technically one day. This may salvage Red State Dem Senators.

Democrats could have a Massive rallying cry if the Republicans renege on their promise for DACA. OR if Ryan screws over McConnell by not even presenting it.

This plays into the long run, and not the short term. The longer Dems held out, the more The Republicans can build momentum. The quicker it's over, the faster it's forgotten."

People don't *want* a shutdown, and there's a real limit to how long to general public will go along with it for the sake of the Dreamers.

Voters who watched the last 6 years of Republicans under the Obama Administration or year 1 of the Trump Administration and are insufficiently ""inspired"" to vote against them are asking for way, way, way too much. Personally, I don't want the Hollywood version of Washington, DC, where everything's always a huge fight, and people take enormous, risky, controversial stances on every issue for the cameras every single week. 

I want competent, experienced, intelligent public servants who focus on responsible governance. That should be enough, and the fact that it apparently isn't explains an awful lot of what's wrong with our government, and our country."

7438,"He offered it to make a point - The GOP is not negotiating in good faith.  And also he offered it because at the end of the day it doesnt matter how CHIP got into the shape it got into, some people will only view it as ""This is the reality we have now, deal with it dems"" and that is just as legit as those who say, like I do, ""We need to look at why CHIP was allowed to run this late and shut down that type of behavior before it happens again""      The minority has to play the hand its dealt and so far I think Schumer is playing his hand very very well."
7439,Because then Trump gets to explain to the American people where the money for that boondoggle is supposed to come from now that they rushed through that tax cuts. Not only is Mexico not paying for it but we can’t afford it either. Give them more rope I say the sound bites are gonna kill em. 
7440,"> There will be no DACA deal, there will be no quarter from Republicans on this.

How was that not true before the CR passed?"
7442,exactly
7443,"I think people are underestimating how bad this will look for the GOP when a bipartisan immigration bill gets through the senate primarily driven by Dem votes but stalls in the house. Its just really bad optics.

The thing that I think Schumer realized is that there is probably going to be another shutdown on the 8th (or another small CR) - this thing won't come to a head until DACA is literally about to expire, so nothings getting resolved until March. What the Dems hoped the bought was an on the record vote showing that moderate GOP and Dems have enough votes for reform and the hardliner GOP and White House are the roadblock.

Yea maybe this move doesn't look great in isolation - but this whole little saga is probably going to pale in comparison to when the shit really hits the fun in early March, and I think that in that context this move puts the Dems in a better position (though I still think they should have just done the CR from the get go and really forced this issue with a shut down in early March when the pressure was really on.)"
7444,"In addition to the wins you mention, the Dems won six years of healthcare funding in the bill they “caved” on. If that’s a loss I don’t need any wins. "
7445,"It popped up on CNN but I can't find a link. Basically, the white house sees this agreement to deal with DACA as something they cannot and will not back, and thus are holding back from agreeing to sign what comes to Trump's desk if it includes that"
7446,"Hogan Gidley, White House deputy press secretary, said Sens. Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin were ""completely dishonest,"" when they presented a bipartisan immigration plan to President Trump.

The plan, he said, didn't address chain migration and failed to provide the appropriate funding needed to construct a border wall.

""To pretend for a moment they had to get together and have a meeting of the minds so they could come together on immigration, those two have been lockstep on immigration for decades,"" Gidley said. ""They want open borders. They want amnesty. That's what Lindsey Graham is about.""

Gidley said he is from South Carolina and has known Graham for a long time.

""To pretend he is anything other than someone who wants open borders and amnesty is just disingenuous,” he said.

Public approval is in support of the Dreamers - but, and this is a big but, that support is in a vacuum. The polls from this weekend show that number drops when you put Dreamers up against ""Uninsured Children"" or ""Soldiers"".

Democrats are the minority party. So they need to strategize how they come at this issue. A public vow by McConnell to address this by Feb 8, and the loss of leverage, both help in that way."

7452,"Sure, but they could have gotten the same deal before the shutdown when the McConnell put it on the floor, literally in the 11th hour Friday night. If they had just accepted the deal Friday, they would have been the heroes who saved us from a government shutdown. Now they just gave the GOP a narrative to use against them today. They traded being the hero party for being the spineless party all so they could (maybe) call the GOP liars for breaking their DACA promise (as if there aren't already plenty of lies to call them out for). It was a bad trade. They played their hand badly. They should have taken the deal on Friday. Holding out for the same thing they were originally offered makes them look weak. Trying to hang their hat on that McConnell promise about DACA makes them look naive. Neither of those are helpful at the moment. "
7453,In the mean time Trump will build the stupid wall like a memorial for his 2016 win. I see red just thinking about it.
7454,"Yep. The ugly part of this is that we have to adjust our expectations to the realities of a minority party. The only leverage we have is (1) bipartisan deals and (2) blocking bills. (1) requires time, which the CR provides. (2) is basically obstructionist, and amounts to holding government function hostage until demands are met. In that sense, it's hugely important that (1) CHIP is off the table, (2) we've already articulated demands of addressing DACA, and (3) we've exposed the problems that are blocking a DACA deal from passing right now (namely, the hardliner subgroup surrounding Trump).

If we force the issue now, against CHIP, all we'll do is turn public opinion against DACA, and that will _really_ kill Dreamers' chances."
7455,"> this thing won't come to a head until DACA is literally about to expire, so nothings getting resolved until March.

Yeah - frankly speaking, this isn't the right time for this shutdown battle yet. The urgency does make sense, and it's important to address things ASAP, but the politics of it don't actually work until the CR and DACA have comparable deadlines."
7456,">OR if Ryan screws over McConnell by not even presenting it.

screws McConnell?  I think McConnell is counting on Ryan not bringing it up for a vote.  I avoids having to have Trump decide to veto it or not."

Who would have thought this? I can't think of any group in America who would've come to this conclusion. Republicans sure as shit wouldn't have, and Democrats seem to be split between ""shut it the fuck down"" and ""DACA is not worth a shutdown"". I can't think of a single constituency in America (other than, maybe, the media, and that's a big maybe) who would've trumpeted Democrats for averting a shutdown."
7461,"DACA advocates and progressives have not yet been able to make the case that DACA is worth shutting the government down over. That could change in three weeks, but that's where we're at *today*, whether I like it or not. Schumer's deal gives activists three weeks to change that to get *at least* even odds, and they need to get moving on it now, rather than bickering about whether Democrats ""caved"" or whatever.  "
7462,"I think the Dems did fuck up in terms of timing and reading Trump and that's why it happened. That Schumer Trump sat. meeting was supposed to end this but clearly the Dems misread the situation. Ending the shut down, freeing CHIP and waiting for March is them sort of reverting to plan A."

7466,"The politics of government shutdown vs. DACA will probably only start to work when the shutdown and DACA are at comparable deadlines. Until then, Democrats' goals should be to drag the GOP through the mud, and expose their hypocrisies and dysfunction (e.g. refusing to address DACA as an issue). That's why getting McConnell's acknowledgement for a vote, even if he's lying, is important - it's saving ammunition for the fight to come.

In the meantime, yeah, we get to hold our breath for another month or so. :("

Not sure whose opinion or where it has been changing.

Vast majority of polls blame the Republicans. That hasn't changed. 

Republicans have house, senate majority, and the white house.

Only need a few ads to remind voters who controls shit, and thus who is fucking things up. Dems should easily be able to do that.

7469,"LOL. There will be a DACA deal. Everybody, including the GOP, wants a DACA deal. It is the one rare consensus among americans.

"
7470,Under what circumstances will you be ok with funding the wall?

7473,"The latest WSJ poll said the majority think DACA is not worth shutting down the government for. Don't forget this is just the first working day of the shutdown. People will lose patience quickly. 

Everybody knows you can shut down the government with just 40 votes."
7474,"Oh I agree there will be a DACA deal. It will just be a DACA deal minus the wall. Or only with partial funding. VERY partial. Mulvaney said Schumer only offered 1.6 billion of the 20+ billion needed.

At best, that is what Trump gets for a DACA plan.

Edit: Doubt democrats will create about another shutdown too much. Republicans are the majority party in all branches of government. Majority party always gets majority blame. Doesn't matter if it isn't correct. That's just how it works. 

See: The government shutdowns during the Obama administration.

I agree. Hence why Republicans successfully did this against Obama. 


>Everybody knows you can shut down the government with just 40 votes.

Again, hence why Republicans did this against Obama, and guess who got the brunt of the blame then? Wasn't Republicans at that point. 

Same will happen here. Except the democrats will be leveraging the political points this time. Doesn't matter if they don't have a super majority. Voters will always blame the majority party. 
"
7478,"Okay, by saying ""the next one could be worse"" you just admitted you realize the Democrats actually didn't fold on jack shit—unless you're using the metaphor literally to describe not taking bets on this round and waiting out for the next one you can actually win? 

They didn't fold, they parried. GOP released attack ad after attack ad saying Dems were holding the govt and workers' wages hostage (newsflash: it was the GOP holding it hostage), the Dems demanded a vote on DACA in the budget talks or they wouldn't EXTEND the budget, the GOP came back and guaranteed a vote on DACA in the budget, meaning the Dems WON THE HAND. So how is this folding? they just got the bargain they asked for WITH A 3 WEEK WINDOW TO DO IT OR THEY'LL GO BACK INTO A SHUTDOWN.

7494,"I call this the ""Long Con"" in that they now have 3 weeks to NOT tank their polling ratings (the Dems) while they try it the ""compromise route"" — if they don't succeed, they still have a shutdown, but they didn't hurt Americans in the process. The blame will ONLY be on the GOP if they fuck this up, and they very likely will. So it's a win/win for Dems. They get a vote and they get exonerated from blame for causing the government shutdown the second time: ""we gave the GOP a chance to negotiate, they went back on their word, clearly they're just holding the government hostage and we cannot allow it."""
7495,"It's called politics, babe, it is NEVER black and white and always requires nuance. If you don't see that, you're the one performing mental gymnastics to call it a loss. It's sad, really, that you can't keep up."

All you got out of this was an unclear date of a future immigration vote. You got taken to the cleaners buddy."
7499,"Then you went in expecting to win a battle you should have known you were going to lose.

You can't face a 2-week CR + CHIP funding, and say ""No! I want DACA NOW!"" and expect to get a political win. Republicans are _begging_ Democrats to do just that, so they can sell the line that Democrats value their own impatience and illegal immigrants over the country.

The time where the shutdown is on our side isn't now - it's against the deadline, when there's no other option left. Fighting the CR now, with CHIP still in play, is a losing battle."
7500,I believe this CHIP refunding was the only one so far that did not include the Republican poison pills to destabilize Medicare and the ACA.

7502,"> take a principled stand for the DACA recipients.

Rather, I think there's a moral imperative to try to get **results** for DACA recipients. That probably involves taking a principled stand, but at the right time - and I don't think now is the right time. Two weeks doesn't mean negotiations shut down during those weeks, and pushing the issue now will more-likely-than-not sour public opinion by making Democrats appear greedy and impatient (and pit DACA against CHIP in public opinion, which DACA will lose, guaranteed).

Public opinion on DACA is fragile - all the more reason to tread carefully, and make sure not to spoil it. Because you can be absolutely sure that Republicans won't let DACA pass if public opinion turns against it."
7503,[deleted]
7504,"> Perhaps that will change with actual news and images of deportations of young people who are Americans in every way except their birth certificates.

Yeah. Sad to put it that way, but it's very possible the DACA fight can only be won after it's been lost first, and people get a firsthand look at the results. That said, I think there's a shot at getting things fixed before March, but it demands no mistakes in how Democrats play their cards, and it also demands a bit of luck in solving the hardliner aide/Trump veto problem (which I don't think Democrats can do much about)."

You can't trust him, but you can't discount the possibility that Trump said something like that, either. All depends on what the last person in the room said to him.   Seems like just last week Trump agreed to a clean DACA bill in a live meeting on TV."

I think a lot of those voters, including myself, were disappointed with the outcome of the Obama presidency. As a ceremonial figurehead he was excellent in representing us, but awful in regards to effecting real change that people require. 

Now many of those same voters were given the choice between Trump and Clinton and chose the devil they didn't know over the combination of the Clinton legacy and a continuation of the Obama governance. I feel like those voters will again push for a candidate that best positions themselves as a force of change. "

The president shouldn't have rejected the DACA deal he agreed to sign.

Republicans were widly vilified in the media for being obstructionists and resisting Obama's dictates. Maybe try to take a step back and examine things critically.

That was Schumer in 2013, right?
 I'd argue that not reaching a deal on DACA is literally holding people hostage. Honestly, literally. They're going to detain and deport them.

The wall? Healthcare? Taxes? Yeah I agree it is hypocritical. These are not reasons to shut down the government. But not all things are of equal importance. DACA alone merits a shutdown. Throw in chip and I say let it burn. "
7553,"I think I would disagree with your assertion that Democrats are doing the same thing that Republicans were doing in 2013. Given that the Democrats are a minority in both houses, I'm not quite sure how they possibly could do that."
7554,I don't see how. McConnell could bring every issue he wants to a vote but he's afraid his own caucus will shut the government down. This has nothing to do with the Dems.
7555,"So Reagan seems to be responsible for vetoing a spending bill he didn't like, and the Republican Congress was responsible for Bill Clinton vetoing a bill he didn't like. "
7556,"Yes. Pointing out Chuck Schumer literally saying that he would never consider shutting down the government over immigration is completely off topic when Chuck Schumer is rallying the Democrats to shut down government over immigration.

Meanwhile, the post mocking citizen Donald Trump blaming the shutdown on Obama is on the front page of the sub with thousands of upvotes."
7557,"Unless Republicans have a supermajority, Democrats can threaten filibuster to kill any bill."
7558,"Well, no. Clinton's veto of the bill was because of a rider that the GOP attached trying to weaken  and ultimately get rid of Medicare--so it was the GOP's actions that led to the stand-off.

>the Republican Congress over funding for Medicare, education, the environment, and public health in the 1996 federal budget

If the Dem suggested bombing North Korea as part of their deal, I wouldn't then blame Trump for vetoing it. In each case it was the GOP that torpedoed whatever was being proposed that led the shutdowns. You may have your opinions, but please stop trying to rewrite history."
7559,Republicans control both houses. They control all three branches. They're responsible for the shut down. They're the ones refusing to do their jobs. DACA and CHIP could have been dealt with months ago.

I absolutely do not trust that this government sponsored calculator is accurate.  I fear that many will tell their employers to decrease their withholdings, and be really happy about their ""higher take-home pay"" as they vote.

Then their actual tax bills will come in a few months after the November elections, where they voted R because mo' money, and they realize they got completely burned because they owe the IRS $2500 they don't have.

The differences are largely matters of degree, but in some cases significant difference nonetheless.

For example, Bernie Sanders is much more sceptical about trade agreements than moderate Democrats.  He would also be for taxing the highest income earners at a significantly higher rate than moderates. Sanders is for universal tuition -- I don't think moderate would be opposed to it, but I don't think they would campaign for it either."

Everything is on a continuum.  I think the left is more sceptical of TPP than NAFTA.  

When you ask about positions, you have to remember that most politicians don't want to get pinned down until they have no choice -- like in a Presidential campaign. Some folks come forward like Warren and Booker, but others hold their cards pretty close to their vests.  Universal tuition has not been on the radar of folks like Schumer.  Definitely not on Joe Manchin's list of priorities."

If that was what they meant they could declare it then simply type ""masculinity"" yet they keep applying ""toxic"" as though it's a qualifier of the class ""masculinity"" rather than a description of the class ""masculinity"".

As a father of three boys, I can tell you every boy is different. Some are sensitive and share feelings readily and have lots of friends, and others are introverted and less social.

That is what the phrase means.  You do realize she didn't invent the phrase and it has long standing meaning/definition that proceeds her little Youtube?

Firstly, what has that got to do with this video clip person?  So far as I know she's not the Goddess Empress of language.  Secondly, the fact that you have not encountered something isn't proof of its non existence.  I mean you're acting as if this video clip person personally invented the phrase ""toxic masculinity"" because why else would you use her usage of it as your guide to what the phrase means?  If you'd never heard ""toxic masculinity""despite it being a rather common phrase that has been in use for years, why do you expect you'd have heard ""toxic femininity"" before whether or not it's in common use?  And if you had heard ""toxic masculinity"" before, why say you disagree with its actual definition and in your explanation point to how she uses it as though there is no other more authorative source on what it means?"

You see how terrible the double standard is? The GOP holds children hostage and the DEMOCRATS are the bad ones because they aren't willing to let children and government workers (working class people ) suffer indefinitely.


People sat on their hands the last election because they didn't want to vote for the perceived lesser evil, and they then let the GOP gain both the senate and house.

8008,"Nearly 60% blame republicans. I've been trying to tell some of fellow liberals for days that's how this will play. 

Democrats made the point with the shut down that republicans don't give a fuck about dreamer kids, while like 80% of the country does. 

But keeping the shut down to only a few days was wise. Any more and people would be pissed. As it is, no one will remember the shut down by weeks end, but the heartless actions of republicans will be remembered, and reenforced dramatically over the next few weeks. 

This was a well played win by democrats. Anyone who doesn't see this is thinking with their hearts and not their heads."

8013,"Going forward, securing the CHIP funding removes one of the hostages, and simplifies the equations. There were too many moving parts. People screaming that Schumer is a traitor need to calm down a bit. The fight isn't over, it's ongoing. If the shutdown dragged on, it wouldn't have aged well for the Democrats. They need to do a bipartisan DACA deal in the Senate, then put the pressure on Paul Ryan in the House to do something. If the House can't act, we put this in the broader frame that Republicans can't even govern on a 90/10 issue. Ignore Trump in these negotiations.

That's why CHIP only just now got re-authorized. If Dems were in control, CHIP would have been re-authorized instantly, last September. But instead, the GOP did nothing with it to save it as a hostage, the healthcare of millions of American kids."
8022,"Sure. And the weird part is that most people seem to agree DACA recipients should be able to stay, but they couldnt bring themselves to vote for it.

However, this is a very peripheral issue for most people. I don't think a game of chicken should have been played with the US government over it. Even if I agreed with them on the policy, Democrats share some of the blame for playing the game too."

All of the pollsters had him beating Trump by double digits.

Also, Bernie can run in a crowded field against the likes of Cory Booker and other Corporate Democrats, he doesn't need the whole thing set up for him years in advance the way that Clinton did.

8054,"Chip recipients got helped. That's all well and good but I don't think rescuing them actually helped Dems going into Feb 8th. I seriously think McConnel is just going to take a different hostage. 

As far as the ""clean"" DACA vote, it was a commitment to consider bringing DACA to a vote along with immigration, border security, chain migration, health care and a bunch of other stuff. All before Feb 8th. In other words, prime grounds for McConnel to offer up the barest minimum of time for voting before 12:00AM on 2/9 and still keep his word. That's assuming that he even wants to keep his word considering how he screwed over Collins, a member of his own party. That's also assuming he doesn't just offer up a poisoned bill. Again, i feel the need to reiterate that we're putting a lot of trust into the words of a known liar.

Even if it was only for a couple weeks, McConnel got his funding, Schumer got a black eye, and Dreamers got the impression that Dems are willing to throw them under the bus. On top of that, Republicans now know Dems will blink next shutdown. Dems didn't even have the courage to keep the shutdown going for one business day. 

Overall, I think the Republicans came out ahead on this deal. But that's all based on speculation on how i think Feb 8th is going to go.
"
8055,"> They managed to pull the metaphorical gun away from the CHIP recipients, and all but ensured a clean DACA vote

There's a lot of speculation that CHIP was an intentional holdout from R's for just such a situation rather than something they actually opposed.  I believe that CHIP was also offered friday night before the shutdown.  It all comes down to the promise.  McConnell IS on the record in a pretty public way that is unusual, but the way I heard his promise was that there would be a vote on **A** bill not necessarily the Grahm-Durbin compromise bill.  I wouldn't put it passed McConnell to hold a vote on a total sham of a bill in order to meet the letter of his agreement."
8056,"Because a ""clean"" DACA vote while the budget goes through isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Why? Because a Senate vote doesn't make law. The House has to vote on that bill or make amendments and send their version back to the Senate. The House has made no promise to even hold a vote on immigration, and they are far more radical than Senate Republicans. They have an unruly caucus that holds extreme views on things like immigration. Ryan is a spineless leader who won't go around his caucus to work with Democrats to pass their preferred version of the bill. What would likely happen is that the Senate will pass an immigration bill that Democrats like, and then the House will either tear it up or make their own version full of very conservative provisions and wall funding. 

It comes down to whether Democrats in the Senate will vote on a separate immigration bill or insist that DACA protections be part of the budget and are willing to shut down the government again over it. It's going to be really hard for them to get to a shutdown and stick to it, especially since they've already folded once and the public is going to be pissed about another shutdown scare."
8057,[deleted]

8061,"> Barring a miraculous come to jesus moment from Congressional R's, nothing can really save them.

A good compromise can, but Democrats have to be prepared to make some sacrifices, and not pursue the moral victory over Republicans.

A compromise _shouldn't be necessary_ given that Republicans support DACA too, but I think that support is shallow, and unfortunately political compromises aren't really about fairness. Fairness is a question for November, not now."
8062,"Right? the people screaming bloody murder are the same that did not vote, vote for Stein, or for Mickey Mouse. "
8063,"Exactly, the Republicans love the massive federal bureaucracy and hate the military. With the bureaucracy shut down and the military still up and running, the Democrats really had them over a barrel. "
8064,"Seriously. They had the Republicans right where they wanted them. They got their shutdown, the public was blaming it on the Republicans, and they just needed to keep twisting the arms of the Republicans until they offered something they weren't offering the night before the shutdown. Instead they take the exact deal they could have taken Friday night, a 3 week CR with 6 years of CHIP funding, and they got a promise from McConnell that they say they can use to push another shutdown in 3 weeks that everyone with totes blame on the R's cause they broke their promise. 

Dummies, you already had a shutdown that people blamed on the R's. McConnell already broke his promise to Jeff Flake to get a DACA fix that he made to get Flake's vote on the Tax scam. They already had the leverage they claim to be getting from McConnell's promise. 

They should have taken the deal from the beginning, but on Friday, they were saying both Republicans and Democrats support CHIP and the Republicans should not be able to use that as a bargaining chip to bring Democrats to the table, since they both agree on it. But when they agreed to the deal yesterday, they acted as if it was something they negotiated for, using the shutdown as leverage. They already had it on the table. 

The only thing they got that was not already on the table was a new promise from McConnell. But they had plenty of old broken promises from McConnell that haven't been much help getting DACA passed, so the fact that they think one more promise will do anything, only makes me think they are naive, or haven't been paying attention. "
8065,"They got 6 years of CHIP out of a 3 week CR, no?"
8066,"Yeah shutting down the government has never worked to get policy concessions. It's a silly and dangerous move.

8072,"Republicans were using CHIP as a bargaining chip, they gave that up for nothing they wanted in return. They literally folded here.

And now the dems can hold McConnell to his word using this 3 week timer as leverage. They've made it incredibly clear that they want DACA reform with the budget, and McConnell has openly stated that he will bring a bill to vote. If the republicans fail, and the shutdown relapses, their dishonesty and inability to govern will be to blame. The dems never folded, the shutdown is still looming, and they got part of what they want without giving republicans a thing. By definition, the republicans are the ones who folded."
8073,"> No Republican wanted to be the one to defund CHIP

They didn't have to be. By putting it in the budget, they were getting _Democrats_ to vote no on it. They already had the blame game solved, and had vote records to prove it."
8074,"> a ""clean"" DACA ""deal"" will not make it through the house

I've been telling people that if we're serious about DACA, we should really be thinking about what compromises are acceptable in exchange for deportation protection. We must be prepared to sacrifice if we want results, and moral victories will do nothing to protect Dreamers. If we want something that can make it through the House, Senate, and the veto, it won't be something that makes Democrats _happy_ - but it just might make Dreamers happy, and that's what we should be thinking about."

The Democrats should have just taken it, then said ""We threatened a shutdown and they gave us CHIP, we'll save DACA next."" They would have been the heroes. Instead, they pushed a shutdown, didn't get anything that wasn't already offered, then tried to paint it as if the shutdown was worth it. They got nothing they didn't already have. "

Which is why it's so dumb for people to think trying this again in 3 weeks is a winning strategy. The only thing they got that wasn't on the table before the shut down was a promise from McConnell that they plan to use as leverage for another shutdown if he breaks the promise. But that assumes the public will be on their side the second time around. They already had the public on their side for the last one, and didn't push that advantage. They traded it for a chance to maybe be back in that same position later.

It's ugly, but between that and Dreamers, we may only get to choose one.

That's up to us, but it's then also our responsibility to understand what compromises are being made in Washington, and why.

This logic smacks of the idea that ""It's not a victory if I didn't wrestle with my opponent for it"". Is that really how we should view things? Because that sounds like a stance the opponent can exploit (by getting you to refuse objectively-good deals, thus soiling your reputation).

> Looks to me like the GOP got rid of the one thing that would hurt them in the next shutdown.

Blaming the GOP for the shutdown only goes so far if the GOP is the one voting yes on CRs and Dems are the ones voting no. CHIP isn't something that hurts the GOP in a shutdown, it's something that hurts Democrats, and it's good that it's out of the way now."
8098,"> They had the Republicans where they wanted them

Ready with guns pointed at Democrats, with bullets containing the message ""Democrats are holding children's lives hostage to help illegal immigrants""? Give me a break - the situation wasn't remotely beneficial to Democrats, once you got down to brass tacks. There was no ""bird in hand"", and the shutdown wasn't going to continue polling well if Democrats kept voting no on CRs (particularly not ones containing CHIP).

I'm not saying Feb. 8 will be a good situation, but it was bad to begin with. The reality is, DACA isn't something we legitimately have the political ammunition to get passed (shutdowns generally benefit the GOP more than they do Democrats, considering ideology), and feelings and gusto won't get us over the finish line - it will send us over the cliff instead if we lose control. If we really want DACA to pass, we should be prepared to make concessions, for Dreamers' sake."
8099,"No, I dont trust his word at all, and odds are, the dems don't either. That's why the dems wouldn't pass this temporary measure until he openly stated that he'd bring a clean DACA bill to vote.

Now he has 3 weeks to either hold true to his word, or find a way to convince people that his dishonesty and shoddy leadership aren't responsible for the shutdown resuming.

Will the public say ""It's your fault for trusting that liar, why didn't you do anything last shutdown?"" Is it worth the risk? They had all their ducks in a row. They played it safe. The next shutdown may not go their way, but this shutdown was going their way. Why did they give that up?

Also, Mitch McConnell could easily fulfill his promise, debate the bill thoroughly, then the Senate can vote it down, the House can vote it down, or Trump could veto if it makes it that far. So there is no guarantee that democrats will have any leverage when all is said and done. It was a foolish play, and they gave up a good position in favor of possibly getting back in that same position later. "

Going to the point of the a shutdown, holding out, then taking the deal that was on the table before the shutdown, isn't winning anything. Future shutdowns will be less popular.

Depends on what the Democrat vote baseline is - if, for example, all Democrats voted for it, it wouldn't actually need that many Republicans to pass. Compromise doesn't necessarily mean popular among Republicans, it just means popular with **enough** Republicans."

They got greedy, and didn't gain anything and the whole narrative gets flipped because of it. It was a bad play. They should have taken the deal before the shutdown, or played their hand on the shutdown. Taking the deal they were offered before the shutdown after 3 days of a shutdown is exactly the kind of half assed bet hedging that plays into the Republican narrative that Democrats are weak. It's what gets people to stay home on election day. The shutdown rallied the base, and ended in a whimper. It's very frustrating for people who want Democrats to assert themselves. They had the advantage and hedged their bet instead of playing the advantage, and that does not inspire people to get out and vote. "

For a simple majority? Maybe. But as I said before, Trump owes alot of his success on his hardline stance on immigration. I do not see him caving on this as that would seal his fate on a 2020 race.

He's already caved several times in speech, and just been ""corrected"" by other Republicans. He's also negotiated with Schumer, and only circled back after conferring with aides. That doesn't tell me his default position is opposition to DACA - it tells me there's strong anti-DACA influence around him, with a fair bit probably stemming from Miller.

> Really the Republicans have the momentum, they need to stay the course and realize that the Democrats will blink before they do.

And Republicans also need to face the reality that DACA polls well, _even among Republican voters_, and if they really push the issue and start deportations, communities will feel the impact, and the blowback will land squarely on Republicans (the ""I didn't realize it was my neighbor/friend/colleague who would be deported!"" effect). Given the state of the generic ballot, I don't think that's something they want to deal with, and frankly, the biggest support for DACA probably lies in the pain that will be triggered once deportations begin. That's a landmine for Republicans, too."
8121,">He's already caved several times in speech, and just been ""corrected"" by other Republicans.

I never really saw it as such, assuming you are talking about his responses to Feinstien in the public meeting, I saw that more as him thinking that ""clean"" DACA and immigration reform would take place in the same day hours apart.

When did Miller come on during the campaign? I think Trumps always been an immigration hardliner, I think Miller is just the one to put Trump's vision into a defined policy. But I could always be wrong.

>And Republicans also need to face the reality that DACA polls well, even among Republican voters

The thing with that that I am skeptical is the fact it was a push poll. When you couch it in ""Do you want children who grew up in the United States to be deported if they don't remember the nation they are from"" Then yes, that polls really high. But good follow-up questions would be, Should they receive government assistance? Should they be granted citizenship, if so should thier parents that illegally crossed be allowed to move to the front of the line on immigration? [It's also important to note that Trump's position on merit based immigration enjoys pretty decent support too](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/345852-poll-voters-support-trump-backed-immigration-bill)

>I don't think that's something they want to deal with, and frankly, the biggest support for DACA probably lies in the pain that will be triggered once deportations begin. That's a landmine for Republicans, too.

And that, I think, is the biggest advantage the GOP has right now. They got the Democrats to go on record voting against CHIP in solidarity with DACA. The Senate GOP will likely act in good faith and open the floor to a vote, but if it's a shit bill without concessions to immigration reform it will fail, and the Democrats will either go back on their word on DACA, or they will end up looking like petulant children, shutting down the government because they could not get their way. If the GOP plays this properly, they will come out on top, which is bad news for the Senate Democrats.

My prediction is that if the GOP is smart in this, they will take a super majority in the Senate."

And at that time the visibility would be even worse because that's when they start kicking out the daca folks.

If not and McConnell unsurprisingly breaks his word, they can shut it down again but this time Republicans have no ammo since they already gave up CHIP. 

Moreover, DACA expires in March. There's a nontrivial chance that holding out would have lead to there simply being not enough time to pass something before it lapsed."

8169,"Hmmmm, it's almost as if there are more reasons to vote one way or another than what color your skin is! Low effort."
8170,">Can't believe you're saying that when brain dead liberals classify black Americans all the time. 

That is a right-wing straw man of Liberals & Blacks in our nation.
"
8171,You know most black Americans are “brain dead liberals” right?
8172,"If you lose your job to someone who learned English as a second language, maybe you weren't as qualified as you thought. Stop blaming brown people and take your ass back to school. That immigrant worked their ass off to get here, perhaps you should take note. You sound bitter and entitled."
8173,Jesus Christ Immigrants arn't taking any ones fucking jobs. What lazy dishonest bullshit. At least have the balls to fess up to your racism - why try to hide it? We all know what you mean.
8174,"You know jobs don't belong to anyone right? Even if you have a job... it doesn't belong to you. It belongs to your employer. And if they wanna get rid of you in favor of someone who will do your job for less or maybe do it better, that is fully within their rights and is actually a pillar of the free market conservatives always claim to love. Jobs stopped belonging to people when job security went out the window. Guess how that happened? Republicans war against unions and strong pro-business stance is how that happened. They gave the keys to the castle to big business and those businesses have used it and lobbying power to make sure they don't have to give anyone job security.

To say ""They're taking your jobs"" is simply not true. To take something from someone suggests that that something belongs to the someone. It doesn't. That isn't how jobs work. Now if you want to change that and make it so that jobs DO in fact belong to Americans you're gonna need some of that good old fashioned big government regulation that conservatives claim to hate so much. Either that or Unions. Pick your poison, conservatives hate both.

So really this whole ""ERMERGERD IMMIGRANTS ARE STEALIN OUR JOBS!"" is actually a direct result of conservative policies of deregulate and big business. Why would a big business hire local and well hire at all when they're getting their huge tax cuts (E.g the one just passed) without actually having to DO anything? Hell all they need to do is promise they'll do it and well... not do it. As they often do. (See the latest Walmart closures)

You don't get to have it both ways. You cannot have a pro-business anti-union anti-(big) government while also claiming Immigrants are stealing jobs.

Right-leaning policies have created this problem. The solutions are things they hate. This is karma, ain't it a bitch?"

Or they are going to make Bush a Muslim.   I think those were the major ~~conspiracy theories~~ truths behind the JADE-HELM-13 military exercises

* the democrats want to take you money and give it to people undeserving

* there are millions upon millions of illegal voters even though there has never been any evidence. The lack of data just proves how many illegal voters there actually are

8219,He didn't make it to a convention because he made a pact to reach every single district in Texas. That was his campaign promise and his word. The AFL-CIO refused to see the bigger picture here. Beto actually has a chance to beat Cruz. I'm know from canvassing here in Texas.
8220,">Miffed that they were being taken for granted, delegates at the Texas AFL-CIO COPE Convention voted Sunday not to endorse U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-El Paso, a no-show at their weekend gathering in Austin, in his bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

>“Our members are increasingly feeling like, just because somebody has a D or an R by their name doesn’t tell the whole story of whether they support working people, and I think a number of our affiliates had some questions about Congressman O’Rourke’s record and some of the positions he’s taken and I think, unfortunately, he wasn’t able to make it to our convention, so we didn’t really have a way to get those questions answered,” said Texas AFL-CIO President Rick Levy.

This is interesting on a few levels. This is where a lot of unions are with democrats in the rust belt too. Thing is Beto would likely be a reliable union vote. 

I wonder if this is a shot at the democrats in general or they're miffed he didn't come. Either way, even though I support Beto a whole lot, I'm with the union. Time to fight again, unions!"
8221,"Think he didn't go because he's been working a frenzied grassroots campaign, hosting local Town Halls, breakfast taco meet and greets, beers with Beto, you name it. Local, small events. The guy is pounding the pavement like no senate candidate in Texas has that I can recall."

If this upsets you, then you’re the one who should be ashamed. Giving support to the Dems and getting nothing back is why we’re in this shit show in the first place.

The truth is Beto kind of dips his toes into the pool of really making a difference, but he’s too scared to take the plunge. Milquetoast politicians aren’t going to get people out to the polls. Not being Ted Cruz is not going to win the day.

If you want Beto to win, then you need to demand that he dig deep and find his cajones. If he doesn’t, even if he wins, NOTHING will change.

In other words, there was no crisis for DACA recipients.
