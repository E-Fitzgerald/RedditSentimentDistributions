36,"The problem with taxing the top earners 70% is it always turns into taxing the upper middle class 60% and that kills entrepreneurship in the nation and stalls the economy. 

Why? Because the rich don't pay income taxes if they can help it so bracing them 70% doesn't produce the revenue you would want. To make up the short fall you tax the upper middle class. 

Since collectively they have more money but each can't afford the accounting tricks the rich can. But their isn't enough of them to move the electorate and if they are being taxed to death they can't afford to give enough to fundraise their opponents. They are the perfect patsy. 

But this kills the American dream for them as they can't break out of their social economic class and only worry about going down. Without these people starting new businesses the employment stalls or even contracts and thus the whole economy starts to slide into a recession. 

So yeah, I am worried when a politician with no history in economics or math starts to proclaim all the answers can be solved by taxing the 'trippy top'. 

But yes if you tax people who make more then 1 million a year 70% income tax then it will not affect the economy much. Mostly because no salary will be more then 999,000 thousand and the rest in stock options. So it will not affect the economy much but neither will it generate revenue for the government.

It's ironic that the people who are the worst at collecting money for the government are always the ones the most in favor of it. 

Trump's policies will bring in more money for the government then anytime in history. "

Here is the bill:

Introduced in House (12/21/2017)
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act

This bill amends the federal criminal code to require any health care practitioner who is present when a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion to: (1) exercise the same degree of care as reasonably provided to any other child born alive at the same gestational age, and (2) ensure that such child is immediately admitted to a hospital. The term ""born alive"" means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut.

Also, a health care practitioner or other employee who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements must immediately report such failure to an appropriate law enforcement agency.

An individual who violates the provisions of this bill is subject to a criminal fine, up to five years in prison, or both.

An individual who commits an overt act that kills a child born alive is subject to criminal prosecution for murder.

The bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of felony.

A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill.

All my life I have been taught that these ""souls"" were people killed for being believers, but these days I have also found myself somewhat confounded by the lack of mention of the slaughter of the unborn in Biblical texts, especially in light of how Jesus spoke of children.  I question now whether or not this issue \*is\* spoken of, and that it is the millions of aborted children who are the souls under the altar.    
It's a bit of a stretch, but verse 11 \*does\* intimate that they are all killed in the same manner.

All of the ""women's right to choose"" and ""we don't want the baby to grow up in poverty"" stuff are just emotional appeals to get people to be okay with infanticide.

If they say that it is wrong to kill a baby that has survived an attempted abortion, then they are admitting that any abortion is wrong. That abortion is, in fact, killing a human being that, given enough time, will survive outside of the womb. Thus, the logical conclusion that they have to arrive at is that they believe it is okay to choose to kill your child. If they don't do this then their entire argument falls apart. 

The beauty in all of this is that most pro-choice folks don't understand what their argument actually implies. These infanticide bills are making the majority of pro-choice people go ""wait a minute, this doesn't feel right."" It is forcing them to re-examine their reasoning for being pro-choice.

733,Thx 
734,I cannot delete your misleading headline or I would.  From the way you're reacting it seems it was intentional.
735,Your title is still horrible.
736,"Just because people in this sub read the article doesn't give you an excuse for providing a shitty title.

You don't seem like you belong here. You argue just like a leftist without context or nuance. Frankly, I don't see how you haven't already been banned."
737,You've been given a solution. Delete the post and repost it. Problem solved. The point is that it's misleading and you fucked up. Just own it and post again. 
738,"I find it funny how much you refuse, over and over and over and over and over and over, to admit that you made a mistake with the title."

740,"Legality doesn't have anything to do with the definition, intent does/negligence can, we just also classify it as illegal. Murder exists in anarchy. To preserve society, all murder had been made illegal except that which is carried out by the government with just cause, or in some areas where duels would be allowed.. a dwindling number, I believe, though I've never really looked much into it. My bucket list has different goals."
741,"Look up ""CNN Shows Reagan Assassination Attempt Video While Talking About President-Elect Donald Trump"" on YouTube.  It has Don Lemon and it was when Trump was still President-Elect.  It's only 23 seconds."

Either remake the topic yourself, or move past it, That is not in my control."
745,"Yeah, they blocked an anti-infanticide bill. I was confused, too, so I read the article. So was the title good if the goal was to intrigue people into reading. The title was bad if the goal was to give people a somewhat accurate idea of what the article is about, which is what titles are generally for, to help people decide if it's something they want to read.🤷‍♂️"

Because nothing else matters in the world than bitching about a title."

750,You're being willfully obtuse and it's clear to me your choice of title wasn't an accident.
751,"I’ve made plenty. The general rule of thumb is if you make a mistake, you fix it. Unless it’s obvious (like a typo) and doesn’t change the meaning of the post. This completely and utterly reads like the Democrats blocked the recent abortion bill. 

I can’t believe it actually took me this long in the thread to see otherwise, the whole time I thought people had reading problems when talking as if the Democratic senators had proposed the infanticide legislation."
752,Titles should be truthful.
753,That would be a move in the right direction.

>Another positive aspect I'm going to share is that at the very least the Illinois tax payer will not have to pay to incarcerate this man for his STATE CHARGES.

Okay, fair enough. 

So, correct me if I'm wrong, the premise of your post is saying that people deserve second chances and that he shouldn't be stigmatized because of what he's done, correct? Or, if not stigmatized, then he shouldn't be punished excessively? 

In 2007:

>According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case resulting from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police a false name.[32] 

He has a history of providing false information and misleading people. On a subject such as falseflagging racist attacks in a country where situations are already pretty tense, propagating the ""muh im a victim"" narrative that... certain people... seem to gobble up, I believe he has not been punished enough. I believe, had he gotten away with it completely, the consequences would indirectly cause several deaths. "
1104,"It WAS a violent crime.  Violence was done whether it was him hitting himself or his buddies. Violence was done. But what makes this a bigger deal than a typical misdemeanor first offense is that it was done with the intent to cause a violent reaction or to a lesser extent cause discontent toward a group of people. Research how many violent criminals were ""first offenders."" 


I appreciate the Woodstock give peace a chance angle... It's not that we don't want to hear it, its just that its total bullshit in this case. "
1105,"Here is my problem.  If there had been no cameras etc. exposing the hoax, it's possible that two innocent people could have been charged/convicted

1108,"I upvoted this solely because I want more people to have the chance to respond to this. 

I respect your opinion, but I think you are trivializing his actions.

 Yes, lieniency for first time offenders can potentially be a good thing- however this isn't one of those cases. What he did is heinous. The damage to the social fabric of the entire country was notable, this wasn't a paltry shoplifting case- he deserves every ounce of punishment that was supposed to be coming his way.
My bastion of hope at this point is the federal case coming his way."
1109,I do think the timing on this was strange. It was done right after the Mueller investigation came to an end. I think the thought of the Mueller release was so important that this story would be buried and no big deal. Were they ever wrong! 
1110,"I understand leniency in sentencing for first offenders, but they still end up with a criminal record. Sometimes a case will be adjourned in contemplation of dismissal, but it's not closed/sealed until *after* the offender completes the requirements (to ensure that they've complied), and it's not the same thing as refusing to prosecute. It's very unusual for a case like this to be dismissed outright and then sealed before it even goes to trial."

Alongside its investments in start-ups, In-Q-Tel has also developed a special technology laboratory in Silicon Valley, called Lab41, to provide tools for the intelligence community to connect the dots in large sets of data.

In February, Lab41 published an article exploring the ways in which a Twitter user’s location could be predicted with a degree of certainty through the location of the user’s friends. On Github, an open source website for developers, Lab41 currently has a project to ascertain the “feasibility of using architectures such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to classify the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment of Twitter messages towards a specific topic.”

Collecting intelligence on foreign adversaries has potential benefits for counterterrorism, but such CIA-supported surveillance technology is also used for domestic law enforcement and by the private sector to spy on activist groups."

 Yes, the problem predates Trump.  The article details crimes from 2012 to 2018.  Here's another quote from the article: ""In 2017 alone, there were 237 allegations of sexual abuse in immigration detention facilities."" Here's another:  ""Rather than meaningfully addressing these endemic problems in immigration detention, the Trump administration continues to aggressively target immigrants and asylum seekers by stripping away legal protections, ramping up enforcement, and expanding immigration detention. E.D.’s case highlights the real need for greater protections against sexual abuse and more robust oversight and accountability measures in immigration detention, not less. ""

I'm not here to defend Obama.  The large scale detention of asylum seekers needs to stop.  If you want them to come here legally, give them a legal way to apply for asylum.   At the very least demand Trump take this seriously and fix the problem by dealing with the bad actors and implementing systemic change.   I'm neither for open borders nor for abolishing ICE.  This is inhumane under any president and needs to stop.  Period.

The confirmation bias of Trump supporters is like nothing I've encountered.   It's astounding.   Normally I'd debate all day about why your worldview is incorrect and based on faulty information, leave frustrated, and wish you well.  Putting people, children, in what are essentially prisons for incredible lengths of time,  cutting aid to the countries they are fleeing so they can't solve the problem, and then sweeping problems under the rug when they arise is on Trump.  Not holding him accountable, that's on you.  Your votes put him in office.  I did mty best as a citizen to campaign for the lesser evil and keep him out of office.   He doesn't care what we (not trumpians think). It's your votes that put him here, and your votes that sustain him.   It's you all pushing him that will hold him accountable, or your silence that enables his destruction.   Every moral line crossed, every hateful remark unanswered, every political norm destroyed, that's on you.  No matter what he does, no matter how many times he reveals himself not to be the man you hoped he was, you support him.  That's why he just keeps going.  Want to have a political debate about the Trump agenda?  Any time my friend.   But sweeping problems like this under the rug while he continues to insist small caravans of desperate asylum seekers is somehow a national security threat goes beyond what I can discuss civilly.  I can not understand how you could possibly condone this demonization and inhumane treatment of people who have been traumatized enough and just want to live in peace. "
1212,"Reading your responses, it's very clear to me that you believe that people deserve what they get and what they have.   As this simply isn't true, I don't think we can have a productive discussion.  We will axiomatically (I don't think that's q task use of axiom but I'm using it). I don't think we can have a productive conversation. "
1213,"The ACLU can use all the inflammatory adjectives and adverbs it wants to.  How they manage to take an issue affecting a fraction of a percent of the detainees and call it ""endemic"" would be beyond me, but...it's the ACLU.  They're hardly known for their adherence to sense or reality, only their furtherance of the leftist agenda.  Is the assault of detainees a problem?  Of course.  Does a fraction of a percent warrant a systemic change?  Nope.  Additional personnel, cameras, fewer ""dark"" areas, sure.  Overhaul?  No.  
  
If the rape of those who are in the custody of law enforcement is something people want to get worked up about, real prisons put up numbers a hell of a lot higher than that.  Why don't we hear anything there?  Or another case:  Is the real problem the fact that people are being assaulted, or the fact that you can find a way to pin it on Trump?  Because you do realize that between 60 and 80% of the women making their way to the border are raped along the way, yes?  Surely this is the problem of greater degree, so why are democrats so deafeningly silent on it?  Same reason for both - they're not reasons to bitch about Trump.  ""Period.""  Of course all 3 can and should be addressed, but the fact that the left third of the electorate only shows even the slightest concern over the one they can use politically is more than a little bit telling.  
  
In this context, what problem is being swept under the rug?  Do you have reason to believe that these cases aren't being investigated?  Did you miss where Trump is sending a small army of immigration judges to the border to clear the log of asylum claimants?  They do have a legal way to apply for asylum.  This is it.  The problem is that there are tens of thousands at a time, and we can't exactly put them up in the Hilton while they wait their turn.  We tried just turning them loose into the country and saying, ""Bye now, come back for your hearing.""  Know how often they came back?  Three percent of the time.  Does that sound like a group of people trying to enter the country in good faith, with legitimate asylum claims?  It doesn't to me.  
  
In the context of this discussion, I don't see anything to hold Trump accountable on.  If you bring kids with you to a place where you know you'll be locked up until a hearing (and you know they're fully aware), they'll probably be in there with you.  In other words, if you bring your kids to jail, don't then complain that your kids are in jail.  As for Hillary having been the lesser of any conceivable evils, I guess we just plain disagree there.  But if Trump didn't care what his opponents thought, would he have compromised as far as he has on the wall?  Would he have signed the omnibus last summer that funded loads of programs he hates?  Would he have left his door open to the democrats to come make a deal, the entire time, while they sat on their asses and let the clock run out (incidentally, completely passing on the opportunity to make a deal on DACA)?    
  
It was my vote that put him there, and it's my vote that will keep him there.  Your personal moral judgments aren't meaningful to other people, and the destruction of political norms is part of why I put him there.  And to clear up your next sentence, he's exactly the guy I hoped he was.  I appreciate your empathy for these people, but they know the deal.  You wait for your asylum hearing and you deliver your case to the judge.  They know this going in, and they accept the deal.  These people do have agency, you know?  To blame the guy who didn't invent the system, and is actively working to improve it while offering no solutions beyond ""yell at him to fix it"" isn't super helpful."
1214,">Reading your responses, it's very clear to me that you believe that people deserve what they get and what they have.

Close, but not it. What I believe in, is accountability. People need to be held accountable for their actions. If you choose to put yourself in a situation where possible outcomes are undesirable, then you must either be willing to accept those consequences, or do not put yourself in that situation.

&#x200B;

>I don't think we can have a productive conversation.

Productive is subjective in this context. If by productive, it is to your benefit, fitting your reality, then I concur, this wouldn't be beneficial to you. You seem to be taking the stance that people should not be responsible for their actions, and I say not only should they, but that the must.

&#x200B;

As my latest analogy, If my family was starving and I stole groceries from a store and got caught, the reasons for doing so would be understood by most, and could be argued that it was needed or that I had no choice, but that is wrong. I would know the risks of my actions, and by taking such action I would need to be held accountable for being caught for stealing.

The resulting punishment, for stealing could be incarceration, which then would put me in a very bad situation, with a high probably of being sexual assaulted. Again, another inmate sexually assaulting me is wrong, but had I not chose to steal groceries, even with my family starving, I would not have put myself in a situation to where I could and most likely be sexually assaulted.

I doubt there is any Trump supporter who would condone sexual assault, for any reason.

The balance of powers is intended to thwart any party from going too far.   You all complained when Obama took any executuve action, but Trump runs the country like a dictatorship.   Also, want to solve the immigration problem?  Hire judges.   The system is structurally designed to suck at processing claims.  There are too few judges, and now Trump wants them to clear asylum cases in less than a day?  That's insane.   Not due process.

1216,"I'm just gonna respond to the first thing you said because I feel that's key to our being able to find some common ground.   While what you say is true, what responsibility does a society have to people who are in crappy circumstances, or who made a crappy choice?  You used the analogy of being raped.  You said something to the effect of if you are raped in jail you bear some responsibility because you did something that landed you in jail.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Let's start there.  Let's say somebody commits a crime and goes to jail.   What responsibility does society bear for the well being of that person.  Do we owe them jail time proportional to their crime?  Do we owe them safety in jail?  Access to education, life skills, rehabilitation?  Let's start with your example of a starving person stealing food and move on from that point.

&#x200B;

>What responsibility does society bear for the well being of that person.

and:

>Do we owe them safety in jail?

Judicial reform is a very large topic with many aspects. Let's start with a very simple answer.

Society bears the responsibility to provide for the inmate, food, shelter and safety, does not need to be pleasant or even enjoyable, the point of incarceration is punishment for violating a law that we as a society has deemed unacceptable.

&#x200B;

>Do we owe them jail time proportional to their crime?

I do believe that we have laws that if violated are too extreme in their punishment, incarceration for the most part should be punishment for when someone's actions harms others. We remove them from society so that they may no longer harm other people. There are exceptions, like repeat offenders, say for larceny. Stealing groceries as my example, yes it would depend on who they stole from. Stealing groceries from say a large national chain isn't as detrimental to society or a person(s) as say from your local corner grocery store. What happens when it is their 3rd time?

&#x200B;

>Access to education, life skills, rehabilitation?

Yes, we should. If we educate, inform and help them become a contributing member of society it is to our betterment as a society. We can teach them skills, so upon their release, they have more opportunities then when they went in, to deter the repeating the same or other actions that would result in repeated incarceration. Thinking vocational skills, we have plenty of jobs that people may not want or even enjoy, but it is better than no opportunity at all. No one said life is easy, or that we are all guaranteed a dream job with great pay. Hard work, is well hard, doing bad / wrong is often easier than working hard.

1402,"Your child not being vaccinated allows them to be a carrier of these illnesses.  The only way to keep them from becoming ill and BEING A CARRIER is for them to be vaccinated against the illness.  There are people in our communities that are unable to receive vaccines because their immune systems are compromised by illness or medication to treat a life threatening illness.  These people CAN NOT receive the vaccine that they would willingly take to protect themselves because it would cause serious health risk.  These same people if they contact the illness by unvaccinated people could potentially lose their lives from a simple and harmless disease that your snowflake could shake off.  So unless you for some reason have an explanation to why your child is more important than the rest of the population and the other families in the school, keep their asses AT HOME or vaccinate like the rest of the civilized people.

When you realize that he has been *wrongfully* accused of being a “Russian agent” for 2+ years non-stop, you’ll realize that he has been more than patient.  More than kind.  Allowing his corrupt, inept, subordinates, to keep up their charade, with whispered “unspeakables” about things they “might” be finding.  It was all a lie.  Trump knew it was a lie from day one.

He calmly sat and took it all, waiting for this day.  Now it’s out.  Everything was a lie!  The entire investigation was a hoax!  We would have been better off if there had never been such an investigation.  Yet Trump allowed it to continue.  He allowed all his staff to talk to Mueller unfettered.  He allowed 15,000 pages of his staff’s notes that are protected by executive privilege to be examined by Mueller.  He had every right to prohibit Mueller from seeing them.

1626,That's exactly what we do. Now do what the Bible says about uninvited people.
1627,"These passages are taken totally out of context. These “immigrants” were people who were moving to the theistic nation of Israel. The entire middle eastern world knew Israel as followers of Yahweh, and they were ostensibly moving into the nation to adopt these same faith practices. These Bible passages are from books which also call for harsh punishment during this ancient era, to any who claimed to follow God, live in the nation, and refused to repent. This is an intellectually dishonest comparison. Go read the entire Bible before you start quoting. Thanks."
1628,You’re being intellectually dishonest by taking those verses out of context.  You won’t win on this hill.  ;-)
1629,Where does it talk about illegal aliens?
1630,"Does anyone notice that this is a time when there were precious few, if any, social programs. If you weren't forced to pay for them, why would you care? I'm thinking either no, or not as much. 

It is the same dishonest question of why did we allow irish and polish and European refugee's here - well, because there was an actual war going on, their was actual starving going on, and when they came here if they didn't they didn't eat so it was little skin off of anyone's nose."

We can't detain families together.  We can't separate kids from adults they came with.  ICE only has so many beds.  There's 4,000 being apprehended daily.  

Where do you want them to go? The people who voted to give them sanctuary are the people who should take them in.  At least those districts had a vote and went with sanctuary.  I never had a vote about turning my neighborhood into Minnesomalia."

There's an easy solution to ending sanctuary cities: send in the troops. But Trump is hamstrung by the nasty cunts of the Dems now."
1698,"I agree, deport them or close the border. Some dumbass judge will block it. Only alternative is to release on interior of country. So why not send them somewhere already blue and screwed up by virtue signaling losers?"
1699,"You're not very bright are you. It's called playing by their rules, if it blows up in their face, all the better."
1700,"As it stands they’ll just flood non sanctuary cities. Congress sits on its hands. Democrats continue to obstruct every effort to build the wall or change our insane immigration laws. We’d all rather none of the illegals even get a chance to enter the country. I’d like immediate deportation at gun point if need be.

With that being said, sending them to cities that have advocated for full on defiance of federal immigration law and consider themselves above federal immigration laws is in my opinion exactly the remedy needed. The illegals will end up here anyhow. Do you expect them just to crawl under a rock and disappear? 

Sanctuary cities claim to be sanctuaries for illegals. Well, give them exactly what they ask for. The government and our elected officials refuse to address the issue. Our solution is turn them back as soon as they enter. I go one step further, March them back at gun point like you would any pow. This isn’t a reflection on us, it’s a reflection on the absurdity of our immigration system. We are at our wits end with this shit.

Send them to sanctuary cities. They’ve literally asked for the illegals. Well, Trump is offering them exactly what they wanted.

1795,"Democrats are turning your states into San Fran,stop blaming a plant for that."
1796,"Source?  But regardless, by that logic the Chihuahua, German Shephard, ""bulldog"" and bearded collie breeds should all be banned as well?  All are sourced by the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in reported bites as much or more and also to be more aggressive than the Pit Bull.

Or just hold the owners responsible rather than blanket demonizing any one entire breed."
1797,"Ooohh...  banned in Canada!?!?!!!... Must be 100% right then... 

Do some research and figure out gender pronouns before you come using that ass backward place as an example to research. You're fucking clueless about the breed. Do some research on this shit."
1798,"Banned in Canada due to being bred for the purpose of dogfighting and being a heavily unstable animal.Can you read or do you get triggered as soon as I type Canada? I know about Bill C16,it has nothing to do with pitbulls."
1799,"No kidding? I though C16 was about pitbulls. Thanks for the clarification. 

Guess both are simply products of idiot liberals who want to control your life. 

Again, maybe don't use a Country w/ C16 on the books as an example of sound legislation. Or ""do some research on this shit"""
1800,"I'm sorry that Canada triggers you,but pitbulls are garbage animals and children have been harmed by them too many times so fuck off and provide a rebuttal if you can."
1801,"You're talking out of your ass. Were Pit Bulls ""garbage animals"" when they were the symbol and mascot of the US Navy or when people like Thomas Edison, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller and Teddy Roosevelt owned them?

Were they an ""unstable breed"" when the world loved a group of kids and their dog Pete known as Our Gang? I don't recall Pete being a threat to Spanky or Buckwheat.

They were great, loving animals that were universally trusted and viewed as a symbol of loyalty until they became cool to hip hop culture and came in the hands of irresponsible idiots and they acted simply how they were raised to act.

So maybe it's just idiot liberals who turn the actions of a few irresponsible morons into blanket assumptions, then repeat those assumptions to enough idiots who will blindly repeat the same bullshit as fact.  That ""fact"" then turns into BS legislation, then more uninformed idiots in turn use that BS legislation as more basis of ""fact"" in venues like this. Then people like me have to write shit like this, because idiots like you simply follow along holding the out-turned pocket of those who think for you and tell you what to believe.

Bottom line, you've never owned a ""pit bull"", you've most likely never been around one for any length of time, you know nothing about the breed outside of what the press and Canadian legislation tells you.

The same press and legislation by who tell you what pronouns you can use. 

Just admit you don't know shit and don't tell someone else to, ""go do some research on this shit"" when you're simply playing the good bitch and repeating what you are told. And especially don't then flaunt your ignorance to the point of citing Canadian legislation as a basis of truth and correctness, Zir."
1802,"I don't care about or have proof of any of that.You are not providing any either so who is really talking out of their ass about this? The idea that us humans would uphold the companionship of an animal at the expense of our human children who cant defend themselves against it is ridiculously despicable to me.You don't deny this is happening,you just keep insisting it is terrible dog owners.Maybe it is,but terrible dog owners are always gonna exist and pitbulls are still more dangerous than other dogs under the exact same owner.They naturally have an overly vicious nature and I will always agree with protecting children from being harmed or killed by them.Not to mention,the pitbull will be put down after harming or killing a human being so them being banned as pets is a service to the pitbulls as well.I find it odd that you are most likely pro life yet you are advocating for a world where kids can get wrecked by pitbulls.You want them to live through that or die from it at such a young age,you are part of the problem our society is getting fucked by right now.I believe in providing quality of life or not at all.Maybe then we won't have losers all over our streets,provide for them or don't even create them.Pitbulls run contradictory to this even when they aren't being used as guard dogs in a drug dealer's basement until they attack police and die for it."
1803,"What proof do you want? 

A 15-year study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association identified multiple factors to a fatal dog-bite attack, none having to do with breed.

According to the same study you have a 1 in 112,400 chance of dying from dog attack, regardless of breed.

1 in 63,225 - contact with hornets, wasps and bees

1 in 9,821 - Air and space transport incidents

1 in 6,905 - firearm discharge

So by your logic we should ban all guns, ban air travel and refuse to let kids go outside for fear of viscous wasps.  If you're pro-life, according to your arguement you would at least. ""For the kids"" right?


Again same study - 

Ranking of canine bite strength, 

1. Kangal: 743 PSI
2. American Bandogge: 731 PSI
3. Cane Corso: 700 PSI
4. Dogue De Bordeaux: 556 PSI
5. Tosa Inu: 556 PSI
6. English Mastiff: 556 PSI
7. Dogo Canario: 540 PSI
8. Dogo Argentino: 500 PSI
9. Wolfdog: 406 PSI
10. Weonberger: 399 PSI
11. Akita Inu: 350-400 PSI
12. Rottweiler: 328 PSI

(Pit Bull Terrier: 235 PSI)

Obviously all those breeds should be banned ""for the kids"", right?


How about most aggressive breeds?:  (in order of more to less aggressive):


1. Bearded Collie
2. Saluki
3. Shetland Sheepdog
4. Basenji
5. Dachshund
6. Chihuahua
7. Chinese Shar-Pei
8. Standard Schnauzer
9. Bulldog
10. Chow Chow

Why not start by banning the most aggressive breed?  I mean, its ""for the kids"", right?

Anyway, I've never been so closed-minded that I couldn't enjoy an artist's work while disagreeing with the political positions, behaviors, past history of the artist.  David Allan Coe is a total asshole, I saw him throw a full beer bottle at a pregnant woman's head at a show at G's Ice House and that's as low as you can get, but I'll still say he was a Hell of a songwriter, and a decent singing talent.  Willie Nelson is all-in for Beto, but I'm not burning his records.  If I LIKED the Dixie Chicks I'd have been up in arms about their boycott, but I think they suck, so I just didn't give a shit, and I still don't.  Fuck them."
1853,"Revisionist history you are touting.  They weren’t “shunned”, people stopped buying their music because they ranted on and on how they hated the USA.  As a result the American people took their dollars elsewhere.  It’s as simple as that."

Also, I was never a fan of Pearl Jam either (can't stand Vedder's WHINE of a voice) but that stool sample at the time the DickMe Chicks imploded also routinely brought onstage with him on tour a George Bush mannequin/effigy which he'd pummel with his fists and then light it on fire - because he was such a *courageous activist*, etc, etc.  I have a tough time separating - and ENJOYING - the ART from the ARTIST when I realize what increasingly-vile scum they are OFF-camera and OFF-stage (or *on* stage) (lunatic DIM Carrey, Squeal Young, Blobby 'tough guy' De Niro, et al).

I was VERY hesitant as I have nothing whatsoever against their music (love Raitt's MUSIC, it's her *personality* that nauseates me) but they just *won't shut up with their profoundly-ignorant rants* (think Steve 'shove it down your throats' Earle, etc).  Made it through Bonnie who *strictly* entertained and just topical banter with the audience - great.  Onto James with his elaborate slideshow in the back, *prominently* featuring his medal-of-freedom ceremony with FroBama and he routinely blabbered on about ''and here's MY president"" (queue Another Sickening Slide for ObaMessiah).

1866,"Coe is legendary for being a total asshole at live shows and turning in a shitty performance but that time at G's was bad even for him.  We stormed the stage and he fled to his bus and of course we weren't given any refunds.  I agree that if I bought a ticket I wouldn't want to have to listen to political bullshit, though.  Like you said, we're paying for the entertainment, so entertain us instead of lecturing.

BTW, I own ""Nothing Sacred"" on vinyl.  Haven't come across a good copy of ""Underground Album"" yet but I will, it's just a matter of time.  Definitely hilarious stuff, and also stuff that'll guarantee DAC never makes it into the Country Music Hall Of Fame.  People focus on the racial stuff which is low hanging fruit but if you really listen to the songs, especially some of the ones off of ""Nothing Sacred"" like ""Fuck Anita Bryant"", Coe comes off as pretty progressive as far as LGBTQWXYZ stuff is concerned.  Surprisingly open-minded for a guy that anyone on the Left would consider to be deserving of execution.  Like I said, you have to be able to separate an artist from their work.  Crazy thing is, the only openminded individuals I know online are on r/T_D.  everyone else is basically part of a lynch mob over one set of beliefs or another.

One more thing.  Steve Earle is absolutely HORRIBLE about the politics bullshit.  I'd NEVER go see him live because I know he'd ruin the show with preaching half the time.  That being said, I love the man's work.  If Natalie Maines had 1/1024th the talent Earle has I'd say the same for her."

That’s his job as CEO, and the 80s were an interesting time when the government and the rich tried to get the best of each other and depreciation and taking losses became an art. Trump has written about it extensively. Did the OP thinks that this is a surprise?"
1921,"This poses a interesting question. 

For the last 40 yrs he has ran his own show. Quick search shows 22500 employees. Ziprecruiter seems to think the average wage is around 52K although there are others that came up with numbers higher in the 60s and 80s. That said. Each employer matches 50% of all employees for federal withholding. The Trump organization is a private firm. I wonder just how much the man and his crew has paid the US Treasury over the course of 40+ yrs. He owns the matching 50% until he pays it in. Will the pundits ever figure out he has been literally paying for half of his employees income tax before he ever figured out how much he owes individually? Nope no credit for creating cash flow to the Treasury. 

Through that question out there and see what kind of response you get if you are playing in the wild."

1969,"Ridiculous article.   The goal of voter ID is to make it harder to commit voter fraud.

What's really a disservice to our elections and the integrity of our political process is when U.S. have their votes minimized or altogether disenfranchised because a significant percentage of the ballots counted were cast illegally either by immigrants or by flat out political hacks."

1971,[removed]
1972,"I just did a quick scan of the article, but it seems to be about felons not being able to vote until they have repaid all debts/time served? I mean, if you want to vote, maybe don't commit felonies? Show you're responsible enough to cast a vote for the future of the country? I think some felons, depending on the crime, should be able to regain their full rights; but as far as I could tell, that is the case under this Florida Law.

Edit: clarity."
1973,"So in this case, the criminal is required to pay back their restitution before the can vote again, that sounds fair to me.  So it wouldn’t be hard at all for an American to vote if they followed ours laws."
1974,"Felons lose their right to vote which is fine by me especially if they haven’t paid their restitutions, fines and fees. And showing ID isn’t anything new. Some state you have to already and shit you even need to show ID to vote in Mexico. That’s how you assure the same person isn’t voting twice. Or dead people. Don’t see the problem here."
1975,This is a Liberal rag reporting on this. Do you actually think they’re being fair and honest?
1976,"As a fellow Canadian I would love to help enlighten.

By making it more of a challenge to vote, it creates organic safeguards against individuals or groups who would easily find loopholes to election fraud.  If you leave an opening, it will be exploited by bad actors.

You should also know that 'making it harder to vote' is not the same as making it impossible to vote.  If you are serious about your candidate and their platform, you WILL take all steps necessary to make your vote count.  This, as a result, will assure citizens that those who voted, did do with determination and conviction... a net positive for democracy.

You should also be aware that there are still many loopholes in place that make it extremely easy for non Americans, dead Americans, and those who have taken the lives or liberties from those who no longer can vote (murdered) 

Conclusion:  as voting gets treated more professionally and securely, yes, voting gets harder... BUT... voting also becomes more accurate and fair. 

Peace brother."
1977,"Just wasted my time to read a stupid biased article. As for you: You are a stupid low energy shill. Now BTFO. BTW I am Canadian, the French -original- kind. MAGA!"
1978,"My thoughts: At first blush, I disagree with the ""make 'em pay the court-ordered restitution first."" I don't think that's a good rule of thumb, as it could easily be applied to any sort of fee that is owed to the government -- ""Outstanding parking tickets? You are an irresponsible citizen; no vote for you!""

So no. The only measure of ""being a good citizen"" should be the current one -- are you currently a convicted felon? I believe that after you've served your time, your voting rights should be restored, with no other bar to be met. 

I do believe in voter ID, and that only citizens of a country should get to vote for the rulers of said country."
1979,"Interesting that you pick an article that is decidedly anti-Republican. 

What do you think about the push by democrats to keep the citizenship question off of the census? Do you think it's ok that states with high populations of illegals get more representation in Congress?"
1980,"IDK if you read the article but it wasn't speaking about convicted felons voting from prison. It was talking about ex-cons...  


Why the hostility to someone asking you a simple question?"
1981,I wish I was him. Then at least I'd have a healthy bank account!
1982,But hasn't voter fraud been over-stated? I was reading that in the last elections the main places where voter fraud happened weren't due to citizen ID problems but due to Republican operatives?
1983,[removed]
1984,"Weren't some of the founders slave-owners? Does that mean that slavery should still exist in the USA? So in your opinion only American citizens who own land should be allowed to vote? (That's interesting but it doesn't seem very fair.)  


Why should poor people be excluded from voting on laws that affect them personally?"
1985,"Right, but now they are making it next to impossible for ex-felons to vote by having them pay back ridiculous sums of money as so called ""restitution"". The new law just seems to be in very bad faith and seems to be counter to what you would want in a democracy (which is an active citizenry allowed to openly vote in the system of gov't).   


And I'm wondering how Republicans feel about that."
1986,But how can restitution be millions of dollars? Doesn't that seem excessive? Doesn't it raised the possibility that these amounts of restitution are inflated (or could be inflated in the future) in order to keep ex-cons from being able to vote?
1987,">But how can restitution be millions of dollars? Doesn't that seem excessive? Doesn't it raised the possibility that these amounts of restitution are inflated (or could be inflated in the future) in order to keep ex-cons from being able to vote?  
>  
>Also, the article's focus isn't about IDs and voter roll purges. It is about how Republican gov'ts are making it dangerously hard to register new voters by using new laws that grossly penalize errors or discrepancies in registration and voting... So seeing this disturbing trend towards shutting out new voters, how does this make you feel about your democracy?  
Edit: spelllling"
1988,"IDK if they are being fair. But they are probably being honest since the stuff in the article is easy to fact-check. So assuming that everything is factually correct in the article, do you think that the laws being put in place by the Republican gov'ts cited in the article will make American democracy better or more unjust?"
1989,"But the possibility of voter fraud does not equate to actual voter fraud. There have been actually very minimal accounts of voter fraud in the US. Yet some politicians (mainly or almost exclusively Republican) have tried to make it harder to vote based on the fear of almost non-existent voter fraud. How does that help make the democracy stronger, when you are limiting people from voting based on a non-issue?  


Also, the idea of making it harder to vote seems to be contrary to a healthy democracy. Some democracies seem to be trending towards apathy and it seems like a better idea to make it easier to vote, rather than harder...  


And also only last thing: who ever said that citizens need to be serious about their candidate in order to participate in democracy? What's next, a written test at the polling stations that you will have to pass before you are allowed to vote? Who gets to decide who is serious and who is not? Who gets do decide who is too ignorant to vote and who is not? There is an inherent injustice in your line of reasoning..."
1990,Tabarnac!
1991,"So I guess, from your reply, that you're disturbed by these laws that are being put in place to keep ex-felons from voting, ostensibly against the wishes of the citizenry who voted to let ex-felons have the right to vote."
1992,good question. idk.
1993,"Just just take a second to see the article as a warning sign, warning that certain law-makers are trying to skew your democracy.  


Imagine if you replaced the word Republican in the article with Democrat. Then wouldn't the things that these lawmakers are trying to do disturb you?"
1994,[deleted]
1995,"There's already a mechanism for that and it's called expunging.  If a convicted felon wants their record expunged, they have to wait seven years (some states earlier and others sooner) after all time in prison and parole is served.  They cannot have committed any crimes since then, including misdemeanors, pay a fee and appear before a administrative law judge.   The process involves living a crime free life, good conduct, time and money and that's why most felons don't do it.  Democrats want felons to vote because they know most felons vote for Democrats."
1996,"Voter fraud isn't over stated.  It's understated, and probably by the millions.   I don't know what sort of media you read but several studies after the election of 2016 put voter fraud at somewhere between 2-6 million votes.    Furthermore, there have been hundreds of convictions regarding voter fraud across the country.   

The fact that you think it's Republican operatives and not Democrats is so woefully out of touch....Obama actually called for illegal aliens to vote in the election of 2016 falsely claiming that residency makes them virtually a citizen."
1997,[removed]
1998,[removed]
1999,"I'm not a republican, so I can't speak for them. But I can say, do the crime, pay the time. And unless it's a heinous crime (violent/sadistic/treasonous/etc.) then people should be able to work toward gaining their rights, as I said. What that entails should be reasonable, but no I don't agree that felons should just serve some jail time and immediately gain full rights back. They need to show they've turned their shit around and are of sound mind to help determine the future of the country."
2000,I really doubt the courts are concerned about the voting aspect.  They’re concerned on recuperating the money spent on lawyers (if the indigent uses a court appointed lawyer) or on what the state pays for keeping the criminal in prison  (it’s not free)
2001,The laws supported by “most” republicans is to protect the integrity of the vote. Our last election ought to serve as good reason to do this.
2002,Pas besoin de sacrer pour faire passer le message t-d-c.
2003,"Yes, that would be a good summary of my thoughts."
2004,"I don't like it from either side. I don't like it when the democrats do it, for obvious reasons. But I like it even less from Republicans because it undermines our credibility and taints us all."
2005,"I don't have as cynical an opinion of the topic as you do, my friend. I think that in the last 100 years the Democrats have historically stood for helping the dispossessed and the marginalized (blacks', latinos', women's and gays' rights). Maybe they only want to help ex-cons get the vote because it will benefit their party. But I doubt it because historically they help the under-dogs. And that's why the under-dogs (like ex-cons and gays etc,) vote Democrat.

I honestly think (and maybe I'm being naive) that if the Republican party started trying to do more for blacks and latinos and gays and ex-cons, then those groups would start voting for that party.

Wasn't there some prominent Republican that just went out and said that? that instead of trying to suppress the votes of people with these types of laws and gerrymandering, that the Republican party should instead try to convince these groups through the force of Republican political ideas.

Edit: claritah!"
2006,"I didn't know that about expunging. Interesting. So for you, that would be the track to take for giving ex-felons the right to vote?"
2007,"Understated? That is certainly news to me.  
The media I watch,read, etc. are mainly Canadian, also the BBC, some stuff from France, and liberal American magazines like Harpers. And in every single instance that the question of American voter fraud comes up they mention that it is grossly overstated. Every. Single. Time. I don't think that many disparate media outlets have got it wrong..."
2008,[removed]
2009,"So voting should be based on income? That's an interesting thought. But it seems unjust since the gov't doesn't only exist to spend tax-payers' money. It also creates laws that affect all citizens' behaviour. Shouldn't all citizens have a right to give input on the creation of those laws, by voting into gov't their representatives that share similar values?"
2010,"But isn't that poor people's right to try to expand the gov't that takes care of them (if that is a political idea that they think is meaningful for the country)? I mean, just because you don't like their political ideas doesn't mean that you should try to exclude them from expressing these ideas. That's a type of fascism, isn't it?  


There are plenty of political ideas I absolutely hate, but I would never stoop so low as to try to prevent people from being able to express them and vote on them. All law-abiding citizens should have a right and an opportunity to express their political ideas, and let the best ideas win through a vote. It seems to me that to accept anything less is to be a bit of a sore loser."
2011,"But isn't the ""working toward gaining their rights"" what felons are doing as they serve out the time of their prison sentences? What else should they be required to do to have earned their right to vote after they've served their prison time ?"
2012,"Whether you doubt it or not, the possibility exists that these sums can be inflated and used to prevent ex-cons from voting.

That being said, my question was mainly about how a state gov't is going against the wishes of the electorate. Imagine if a Democrat gov't did that (about some other subject than ex-cons). Wouldn't you be upset about it?

I thought that Republicans were the 'law and order' party. Isn't the job of the state gov't  to follow the will of the electorate? Isn't that like the primary law to follow? So how can it be acceptable for a party that is perceived to be the 'law-and-order' party to be so clearly against the laws that run the state? This behaviour seems to reek of bad faith.

Edit: spelloing"
2013,"What exactly do you mean? There was not rampant voter fraud in the mid-term elections, nor in the 2016 presidential elections. And didn't the main election fraud that occurred in the mid-terms happen due to the shenanigans of Republican operatives?"

But why shouldn't people on gov't programs get to vote? (And by gov't programs Im assuming you mean welfare, medicaid, etc. and not the OTHER gov't programs like farm subsidies and subsidies and contracts to weapons and aerospace manufacturers...  


Concerning ""valuable opinions"", isn't democracy about deciding together what rules will be used to run the country? So doesn't that go contrary to your ""valuable opinion"" idea? Because honestly, who gets to decide who's opinion is valuable or not? Imagine two people who don't think the other person's opinion is valuable. Does that mean that they each cancel the other out and so neither of them should be allowed to vote?"
2025,"The only problem with your idea about opinions is the question of who chooses the opinion that matters and the one that doesn't. You? Me? The person already in power (ie the status quo)? The strongest one who beats down the weak? Who? 

The only logical answer that doesn't go down the path of the strong beating the weak is to allow everyone to have an opinion and to vote on who's is the most popular."
2026,"No.  You're not seriously researching.  You're asking polemic questions of anonymous internet users.  A serious research of the issue would start with a) looking at the cases of voter fraud that have been successfully prosecuted and b) understand the history of political parties in the U.S. using voter fraud to rig elections.  May I suggest that you start with Joseph Kennedy recruiting an Italian of the same name as JFK's primary opponent to run to split the vote and confuse the electorate concerning which of the Italians to vote for. From there you could move on to understanding Boss Tweed's Tamany Hall in New York city, then extend it to include the machines in each big city on the East Coast or even look into the Daly Machine in Chicago.  Once you understand the history, the Democrat Party's use of voter fraud, especially concerning immigrant communities, felons and voter fraud becomes much more clear.   That's requires digging into the historical record, maybe even reading a book or two and understanding the voting process and the organization behind it, rather than just asking uninformed questions of random redditors."
2027,"well, it looks like we have found our impasse.  In my multi source universe, CBC and BBC are both State run media outlets who have demonstrated an immense amount of bias... like, Fox News levels of bias.  What separates these entities in my world is that the two State sponsored outlets claim a neutral position, not designed to influence opinions in one direction.  Fox at least  admit to their bias, which helps viewers discern better.... you dont have to agree with the spin, but, you know what you are observing is transparent. 
If media outlets were more honest about their spin... we'd be a whole lot better off.  Although, they expose their bias everyday through their narrative driven scripts.

Has Le Monde exhibited demonstrable bias? Or La Presse? Or the National Post? Or the Globe and Mail? I'm sorry but I don't buy your argument. I think that the state run news shows on the CBC and the BBC are slightly liberal, but only because the populations they serve are generally more liberal. Canadians and the Brits are generally more liberal than Americans. And incidentally, the actual gov'ts in power don't have a lot of influence on the content of the news on the CBC and the BBC. Nor do corporations.

edit: clarity..."
2032,"But aren't people allowed, in a democracy, to vote for people who promise them things, even if those things are not something that you would want? So why shouldn't those people be allowed to vote?  


Are you saying that they shouldn't be allowed to vote because they want to vote for politicians that would give them things that you don't want them to have? Or is it that those poorer people have not contributed enough to be allowed to vote? I'm not understanding your point because I don't think that it is very clear..."
2033,Sounds lonely.
2034,And what's wrong with anonymous internet users expressing opinions. Nothing wrong with that. Collecting these opinions is almost like collecting anonymous votes in a democracy. Who'd have thought!
2035,"Start Here:

From there, you can either research the political machines that exist in just about every big city in the U.S. or focus on the most notorious one in operation today, the one that got Obama elected in 2008, the Chicago Daly Machine.   Did you know that Obama never won a fair and square election before 2008?  He became a state senator by removing his opposition from the ballot.  His former mentor.  Tampering and tinkering in elections is often overlooked in primary elections but in one-party cities, that's where most of the voter fraud is today.  Obama got his supposed friend and mentor removed from the ballot effectively ensuring that he would run unopposed.  Obama became a U.S. Senator because divorce court and child custody papers were illegally leaked to the Chicago press forcing his more popular opponent to withdraw from the race within weeks of the election.   That's telltale signs of a machine operating rather than a fair election.  Chicago has a history of illegally leaking confidential and damaging information against ""favored"" opponents.  It happened to not only Obama's U.S. Senate opponent but also to Joe the Plumber in 2008, Herman Cain and others.   Many insiders believe David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel are behind the illegal leaks that come out of Chicago.  

There's a few other recent elections that display some tell tale signs of wide spread voter fraud, such as the Norm Coleman loss to Al Franken in Minnesota, Broward County Florida's history of mismanaging elections.  Most of California's congressional district voter rolls contain more registered voters than actual people eligible to vote in those precincts.   

Voter fraud can't be looked into in a vacuum as though it exists only as separate and distinct individual cases.  Voter Fraud, when it affects elections outcomes, are almost always the work of a political machine and political machines are controlled by bosses and parties.     Almost all political machines in American history have preyed upon immigrants, legal and illegal.   

It's a temptation in the U.S. to truncate all political debates and process debates down to slogans and soundbites.  Mostly because Americans don't have the time or interest to do deep dives or actually do the research themselves, however, voter fraud isn't isolated and when its effective, it almost always exists within a political machine."
2036,"I should clarify that although I find most publications and media sources are left leaning, I do not automatically dismiss their content.  I have seen enough speculation leading to outcome in my life, agendas become pretty clear, especially in today's internet supported world.
Here's what I see...
CBC reports favorably for liberal and left leaning policy and politicians. They use the color red to brand themselves... the same as The Liberals.  This is fine... this is acceptable.
CTV reports favorably for The Conservative Party and right of centre opinions.  They use the colour blue in their branding... just like The Conservatives.  This is also fine.  it's hidden in plain sight.  We know what to expect from media sources using very basic discernment.
(BBC is blue... The Torys are what colour?  they seem very close as well.)
All of these sources take tax payer monies to further their reach, and perpetuate their brands. Unfortunately, these corporations are not affected by our need for them to be neutral or balanced in message.  They have boards who are very loyal to their bottom line and the agendas of the ownership. Their bias is what generates very dedicated, paying consumers. Being fair and balanced would undermine and erode their bottom line... and would require benevolent ownership. I would love for that day to come... but... I don't see that culture change happening soon.

I wish I could better point to specific examples from these outlets off the top of my head, but, I think the greatest example would b e all of the free passes and fantastic coverage that Trudeau experienced in his campaign, and through the first half of his reign. Trudeau could do no wrong.  CBC, almost overnight, adopted and promoted every progressive ideal that The Liberals could propose.  It was quite shocking to watch unfold... especially through comment sections of their heavily downvoted YouTube posts. It has been depressing watching the media, and my neighbours, take opposite sides.  

It's a rigged game my friend.  Rise above the spin, or be tossed off the ride. 🙂.  My suggestion is to try independent journalists through social media.  They are very passionate, researched and transparent about their bias.  It's ok to have opposing views. 
I love good ideas, no matter who presents them."
2037,[removed]
2038,"Thanks for all of the info, I appreciate it and I'll definitely look this stuff up."
2039,"Well said. But I'd have to disagree with the colour-scheme idea you've got going on. The CBC and CTV don't choose their colours based on political parties. The Habs are red as well and that doesn't mean that they are more 'liberal' than the Leafs (who are blue).  


The CBC doesn't give a pass to Trudeau any more than it did to Harper.  
And I would say that the BBC is generally more liberal than the Tories.  


What I've found is that public broadcasters are often more liberal than privately-owned broadcasters. That seems to be the case across multiple countries and media..."
2040,"Interesting, this is the first time I've heard someone say that America is not a democracy. Is your constitutional republic not maintained and managed through democracy? Cannot America be both? Isn't it both?

I find the idea abhorrent that someone would get to decide whether I (or anyone else) is fit to vote. I understand that you're not explaining it in terms of fairness. But shouldn't you? Shouldn't democracy (like everything) be fair?

Also, how else did we get the USMCA deal? Tariffs.  Pressure.

2049," Well no, sorry, but the media lied to ya."
2050,"Lol, you just outed yourself as an economic idiot..."
2051,"The entire reason the crap from China is cheaper than USA made is because they are taking a loss on it.  The Chinese government pays businesses to sell at a loss to foreign countries to boost their economy.  This comes in the form of subsidized labor, shipping and raw materials.  Then to prevent spiral inflation and the colapse of their economy they manipulate the value of their currency vs other global currencies.  The complacancy of the USA has allowed this to happen and our goverment has been actively particpating in boosting the Chinese economy until Trump.   By placing a tariff on the good being sold in the USA it now represente the actual market cost of the good and the delta goes to the USA treasury.  In the short term some items in the US will have a higher cost, but as domestic products become cost competetive the industry will pick up requiring more factory production, new factories, more workers and higher wages.  The long term effect will be the colapse of the Chinese economy and boom in the USA.  Macro Economics 101."

2253,Give me what you think the truth is then.
2254,When was I outing Jewish people?
2255,"The last time I believed a Leftist who said that he wanted a debate he mined my overture for SJW Brownie Points on r/EnoughPetersonSpam. In my experience a Leftist claiming to want a debate is dishonest, but PM me if you wish to change my mind."
2256,"Trump is the first President in decades to fight *against* the corruption.  That’s why the liberals are acting so desperate these days.  They’ve been flushed out of their holes.  Liberal hatred and intolerance has been exposed.  Your hatred grows by the day.  Hatred is an acid that eats away from the inside out.  Your last statement, is too inane to bother to comment on.

If you don’t get a grip on reality soon, I fear you will descend into mental illness, if you aren’t already there.  Life is good.  People are good (the super-vast majority, certainly).  America is good.  Learn to see all that is good.  Life has so much to offer.  And you have descended into what the Pope in 2016 termed people who believe what the MSM tells them - copraphagia.  Learn to think for yourself!"
2257,Out of touch with what?
2258,Un-ironically? You could at least pretend to have half a brain
2259,"You are projecting my friend. No one here is a nazi, just the opposite. I myself have been a vegan progressive for years, into environmental stuff. You should really try to educate yourself, don't be brainwashed by corporate media. Think for yourself. Wish you the best"
2260,"Browse our sub.  Compare it to what you think you know.  Don’t just accept what is said here, read the articles, think through what is being said, what seems most likely to be true.  Note the obvious lies we show the MSM telling daily.  Why don’t they correct them?  Why do they keep telling them?  After once or twice, it seems hard to think of a noble reason why they would do that.  It’s a slow process.  But if you keep an open mind, do your own research, I think you’ll find that the MSM has convinced you of things that just aren’t true.  And your certain not to find any “neo-nazis” here, whatever that is supposed to mean."
2261,"Watch Steven crowder. Speak to many jewish people and how they are being treated by the Democrats. Form your own opinion. Hopefully you won’t just dismiss the Jews like most Democrats, and hopefully you’ll respectfully listen to Steven crowder who provides a comical way to discuss politics"
2262,"My advice to you is, go beyond politics. Cultivate a strong foundation. However you do that is up to you. Some find it in religion, 'the truth shall set you free'. Understand fundamentally that Life is Good. Go beyond the noise of media, politics, crisis, people shouting the world will end in 12 years etc. Life is always full of struggle, it's good for our character. Be a good person, open minded, don't for a second believe that you know better than others, that you are better than others. Always be prepared to change your opinions if you realize your old opinions are of no use anymore. The way you see life now could fundamentally change in 10 years. If you go through life never changing your perspective it could mean you haven't evolved. Good luck friend"
2263,"Nazis hate jews

2265,"You’ve brought literally no facts to your argument. Recently there was a bill to fund the school budget but was shot down by repub senators because it would increase takes on large businesses by 0.5%. A bill that would provide food and higher student expenditures for young students, all because greedy old white men decided to take money from conglomerates to be their puppets."
2266,You’re saying no one on r/the_donald is a nazi? Also how can you agree with trump when what he has done in office has only hurt the environment? There was no point of him pulling us out of the Paris climate accord.

Schools are *supposed* to be regulated (and funded) by the states.  I pay over $6,000 per year directly to my local school district here in Texas as one item of my property taxes (and it’s the largest - I pay about $9,000 total).  If you feel the schools in your particular state are under-funded, or are not providing enough food or expenditures for young people, take action!  Call your state representatives!  Join grass roots campaigns to take action at a level that is designed to be low enough to hear individual voices - starting with your local school board.  Demand they raise taxes to provide these services.  You will be one of a few voices.  Your voice will be heard.

This is how our republic was designed - important decisions are to be made at the lowest levels of government - the closest to the people.  Keep the federal government out of education!  They won’t listen to you, nor will they listen to me.  The framers of the constitution wanted the federal government small and impotent - it is too far removed from people to be responsive, and thus subject to corruption and bribery.

Please, please, learn to search for your own facts!  The idea that people should spoon feed you facts is (and I’m trying not sound negative, but it’s) lazy.  I know that’s a negative word, but I’m wanting to encourage you to take charge of your own brain!  Only you should decide what goes in there.  Not me.  I’m encouraging you to browse our sub, use those powerful brain cells and synapses you have, and decide for yourself what the facts are in general.

I can tell by your statements you’ve been indoctrinated by the MSM, and they do not have your best interests at heart.  They are the corporate globalists.  They want to rile you up so you’ll click the link, tune into the channel, and soak up their big government bullshit that says the federal government must be the nanny over every aspect of your life.  It’s just not true.  Big government is the *cause* of the huge corporations, growing income inequality, and rise of oligarchs."
2270,"Yes, I can say that with certainty, no one is a nazi here. Nazis are not tolerated, just as left wing fascist are not tolerated. The Paris agreement doesn't help the climate when China and India are allowed to continue to pollute. US emissions under Trump has gone down. Have you seen how the French have been rioting in the streets since the French government tried to put a tax on fuel. It's not the way forward. The free market will solve the problem when renewable energy become advanced and affordable. Also look at overpopulation. 2.4 billion more projected before 2050, half of them in Africa. They want to live like you and me, that means more co2. So no, the Paris accord doesnt solve anything. But don't worry, the planet will survive as it has survived countless times before. Climate has changed since beginning of time. Living is always full of challenges. In the 20th century the challenge was two world wars, defeating nazism and fascism and potential nuclear holocaust. We survived and we will survive the challenges of the 21st century as well"
2271,Dude have you ever spoken to a democrat about what they think of Israel? I get called a dirty murderer daily by Democrats online and in real life just for simply being Jewish without even mentioning Israel. And now they want to take away our only place on earth that’s safe for us? Really?!
2272,The argument against Israel from a democratic standpoint is not against the religion itself it’s about the bombings of innocents.
2273,"Yes, calling any and all jews they meet on the street murderers and ignoring the fact that Israel is constantly under attack and just attacks back isn’t racist at all! 

This is what happens:

Israel gets bombed

Israel bombs back

Democrats: “fucking Jews and murderous Israelis disgusting”

Jews: not all Jews are Israeli...

Democrats: “oh I bet you hate Muslims don’t you”

Jews: “nope, we are pretty tolerant people... we were also given Israel by the people who owned the land so we acquired it legally... the fighting only started after we were attacked”

Democrats: “well you’re attacked in every period in history! Maybe it’s time to look in the mirror and realize you’re all murderers!!!”

I’ve had that convo at least 3 times this week.
5 times last week. 

The Palestinians encourage abuse towards their own women, the Jews do not. The Palestinians fought to take away legal rights from the Jews before Israel was created. The Palestinians started the war that resulted in them losing more land. So who here is the victim? The people who started with violence from the very beginning or the people who decided to fight back and maybe even one up the people who are hurting them? 

If another holocaust or something broke out is real is the only place for us to go. Palestinians have many places to go and have citizenship in Israel if their family was there before it became Israel."
2274,"The 'bombings of innocents' will stop the moment Palestinians, Iranians and others accept that Israel is not going anywhere. When Israel doesn't have to defend itself to survive, that's when there will be peace in the Middle East. But the question is will Palestinians, Iranians and others ever accept the State of Israel. Until they do there will be war. That's why Trump decided to move the embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as Isreal's capital. Because it's the reality. When something is a reality you can't fight it. He's trying to help the Palestinians. Notice how media told us that all hell would break loose if Trump moved the embassy. well, it didn't. So now there's one less thing to fight and argue for"

As far as Trump being a Christian, he may or may not be.. what he does do is uphold christian values, he believes in the right to life. He believes in freedom to practice non-violent religion.

Racist drug laws, our shitty educational system, a welfare system designed to keep families separated, there are many things that our government does that keeps the black community down. 

There has been a lot of anti-libertarian rhetoric on r/the-donald lately. Some of it is just hard core Trump fan boys who are butt hurt that Libertarians are critical of Trump's trade policies.  I think some of it is left leaning Trump fans who only like Trump for his trade and immigration policies and are terrified by the fact that our population is trending very libertarian ideologically.

Culturally, aggressive coercion and forcing ppl to hang out together always backfires. It's human nature. But how do you ultimately teach tolerance or opportunity to judge ppl by character if you don't force an environment to integrate?  This is why you will have some groups who will stay collective and some who will enforce inclusivity. You will have lawsuits or lose customers. The free market will ultimately make one die off. Usually the racists die off. But right to private property and individual freedom will be preserved. Their point is liberty itself will untangle racism itself, I believe. 

Blacks somewhat practice libertarian ideas when among themselves, imo. They, too, are not going to let someone they feel uncomfortable or ""can't survive"" infringe on their private property or social rights either. There's a reason why non-blacks who want to enter their inner circle have trouble. But again, any racist group within a group will regress and die off.

proving that the majority of them have no idea what the ideology even means and they're only identifying is libertarian because it's ""new"" and ""edgy""

They don't like Republicans Or democrats and so they decided to just take a different label on to them and Rebrand themselves"
2390,"As a middle class white guy i know EXACTLY what black people want. And its certainly not anti discrimination laws or the civil rights act. 

I- i mean *they* hate those things"
2391,"So you're saying that the Civil Rights Act was a bad thing? And it somehow hurt black people when we ended segregation? Okay.

and in the same breath field say that the parties never switched and that Republicans are the party that ended slavery and passed the Civil Rights Act Right? Even though you're also advocating to repeal the Civil Rights Act and reinstitute segregation"
2392,"Yeah libertarians don’t advocate for the free market because it “enables racism” but because the core tenant of the ideology is letting ppl make their own choices for their own reasons.  Want to have racist hiring practices?  Ok but you’re going to have to face the repercussions in the free market.  Vote with your wallet.   Contrary to popular leftist belief, actual racism is not an attractive quality business-wise or politically.   Not saying I agree with libertarians about everything but I understand where they’re coming from and don’t have to straw-man them to make an argument."
2393,You seem concerned.
2394,"You're broadly generalizing blacks as a whole, instead of separating their subgroups. I do know smart blacks don't want to be associated or work with moron blacks either. Just like most races. 

Rand stated something around this. ""A genius is a genius, regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race—and a moron is a moron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin.""

While l can see where you're coming from, I really think you're taking their views somewhat out of context. While l don't agree with them fully, just takes a little more effort for ppl to understand libertarians, imo."
2395,"No, I am not saying the Civil Rights Act was a bad thing, I am not a libertarian. And BTW, the parties did not switch, biggest ruse they played on people to hide the fact the Democrats were the party of the KKK, segregation, and racism."
2396,"Oh. I guess I had it all wrong. They're only trying to repeal the Civil Rights Act because they support Freedom? Okay well in that case it's fine. It doesn't matter that it would still Institute segregation and discrimination on black people. As long as it's for some other reason than racism then it's perfectly fine to support it and black people will be stupid to advocate against repealing the civil rights act 


the same way you can't be against the Patriot Act and warrantless spying. It's got Patriot right in its name. Obama only implemented it because he supports patriotism."
2397,And literally not one part of your response at anything to do with what I said
2398,"I'm not arguing that they switched or not.

I'm just saying that if you're going to claim that the Republican party is the same party that passed the Civil Rights Act you can't also be advocating to repeal the Civil Rights Act

Libertarians are advocating to repeal the Civil Rights Act. Whether you want to admit it or not 

Shutting your eyes and covering your ears in the face of that is what liberals do. You just don't want to admit 

but if you go to any libertarian convention or go to their subreddit and you ask them they will be advocating to repeal the Civil Rights Act. It's just a fact. And facts don't care about your feelings"
2399,"This is why I said it was a strawman, nobody is trying to repeal the civil rights act lmao."
2400,"Wow you had a moment of clarity.  Yes you do, in fact, have it all wrong.  If some libertarians want to repeal the civil rights act because they think it’s an infringement on freedom they’re allowed to advocate for that because freedom means hearing views you don’t agree with.   Doesn’t mean you or anyone has to support their view. People are allowed to be wrong.  Trying to edit and control a person’s worldview is authoritarian bullshit, championed by the left.   I don’t agree with repealing the Civil Rights Act but I don’t turn into an immature fuckwit when confronted with the idea.  The free market of ideas in the US doesn’t support repealing The Civil Rights Act so those libertarians will live and die by their principles.  I have heard no one of any political relevance advocating for that either so it seems like you’re focusing energy on a small, irrelevant group of people.  Bush implemented the Patriot Act btw."
2401,"Sorry. Was that not sarcasm? I was just pointing out that there are different groups of thought among blacks too. 

Libertarians weren't fundamentally against the civil rights act. They criticized the ideological part of govt aggression and coercion. They wanted to delegate the roles of segregation by society, not by the govt?"
2402,"The Libertarian party may indeed be acting to repeal the Civil Rights Act, I don't know. But I don't suspect its due to racism by and large, but more from what they see as Constitutionality. They certainly do not believe the free market makes blacks poor. Actually, in my opinion, from libertarians I know/knew, and from what I learned when I was a Libertarian for a very brief period in the 1990's, they don't seem to concentrate or think about race all that much."
2403,it doesn't matter what they meditations are. That's the point. And the meme never claims that they were racist. If the end of the day it doesn't matter what their motivation czar. What matters is what they do. And what they want to do is Buster racism by repeating the Civil Rights Act. It doesn't matter if it's because they all love him ponies or because they're evil KKK people. That part doesn't matter. The part that matters is what would happen if they got into power. And no rational black person is going to vote for that kind of thing
2404,"What they are told would happen if they got in power, and many believe it. Not what would happen if they got into power. They are not Libertarians, just the same as they are not Republicans. They are not Libertarians, or Republicans, because they are Democrats, and they continue to believe their BS, even though the party has failed them miserably. Trump was going to make slavery legal, Trump was going take voting rights away from black people, again Hillary would spare them such an awful fate as (lowest unemployment rate, highest home ownership rate, wage growth), and they believed it, and still do. So if things like this bring the coloreds to heal for the Dems, and they do, then that is why they don't seek representation outside the Democratic party. Why are black people not Libertarians... because they would take the pittance the Dems pay you to be poor, pregnant, and dependant away. Seems to work."
2405,"It is. It has, just not the way he envisioned. President Trump is trying to set that right."
2406,"Dont worry, he will.

2424,"That is a complicated question and frankly a little anti-Semitic.  In my simplistic opinion, there are two distinct reasons: (1) Israel is the only non-Islamic democracy in the entire region and we have strong geopolitical and military ties to Israel. (2) This is the sticky part for a lot of people, because it involves religion. If you are a Bible-believing Christian then you know that Israel is the rightful homeland of the Jewish people, and has been for over 3,500 years.  Israel played a critical role throughout Biblical history and plays a vital role in prophecy. For example; do some research on the Third Jewish Temple and how it is central to the second coming of Christ."
2425,they dont have democrats
2426,"Just wanted to clarify before I say this statement that this post isn’t intended for anti Semitic purposes, but in the second coming of Christ many catholic saints and the Bible says that the Jews will assist the anti christ in coming to power.

Get off your ass and get a job.  What happens when everyone gets free stuff and stops working?  🤔"
2434,What are u talking about? It's their business you don't have to work for them. Look at someone like Jeff bezo... do u have any clue how many people he employees? All he does is share his wealth with others.  The economy benefits greatly from the company he built.  What it is with whiney liberals hating that other people are richer than them? U want everyone to be poor like u is that it?
2435,Tell that to the CEOs.
2436,How does he get that wealth? He certainly doesn't get it by doing any real work. He gets it all by exploiting his workers and robbing them of their bonuses. All the pay that they deserve gets funneled directly into Bezos' pockets. He gives less than 1% of his income to charity every year. He is not a philanthropist.
2437,Become a CEO.
2438,All of his factory workers are people who didn't go to college and have little options in life.  You don't get to make 25 dollars an hour for stacking shelves. It's for people who don't have many options and want a solid job.  He provides that to thousands of people. Same with McDonald's.  U don't get 25 an hr for working there because it doesn't require much brain power.  It's charity in a way. The people stacking shelves for Amazon are riding on his shoulders and riding on his hard work.  U seriously think Jeff bezo didn't work his ass of to get where he is? Grow up u sound like a 15 year old communist who knows nothing about the world
2439,What's 1 percent of 50 billion?  More money given away in one year than ull make in your entire life you pathetic fuck. Jesus you're pathetic.  Ugh he has more than me! That's not fair!  You communist faggot
2440,"He gets it because a whole fucking lot of people use Amazon.  Did you invent Amazon?  No. If you get out of your ""I'm entitled to your money"" attitude and focused that energy on improving your life, may you'll succeed and stop being jealous."
2441,"I can't because the 1% have rigged the system so heavily against working class people that if you are not born into an immense amount of wealth, like Donald Trump was, you will almost certainly never be able to join the ranks of the ultra-rich."
2442,"It is absolutely not charity if 11.8% of Amazon's workers are surviving on food stamps. If a company can turn billions of dollars in profit, yet still can't pay its workers enough to survive without needing food stamps and welfare, that company is exploiting its workers."
2443,"Yes it's more than I have, but he still has the other 99% of 50 billion, which is more wealth than any one person would ever need and he still exploits his workers to acquire such an absurd amount of money."
2444,"I don't think you realize how the free market works.  There is nothing stopping you from learning and educating yourself and working hard to bump Bezos (or whoever) right out of his spot or creating your own successful business.

2445,whos working at Amazon that cant survive without food stamps and welfare? The average full time employee at an Amazon warehouse makes 15 dollars an hour. Thats like 30 grand a year after taxes. You can live on that no problem if youre not a retard with your money.
2446,"see thats spoken like a true communist... You see someone who has a lot more than you and you think ""nobody needs that""  I see someone who has alot more than me and I think ""thats fucking awesome... Everyone should have a shot to get to live like that""   and you do in this country. Dont be such a cuck seriously. These billionaires are the ones who gave you Xbox, netflix, and your iphone. You like those things dont you? Theyre businesses benefit everyone. And they provide more charity than anyone.. They say oh u didnt go to college and zero chances in life? Here ill pay u 12 an hour to stack boxes. HE COULD GET A FUCKING ROBOT TO DO THAT FOR HIM. But instead ill pay you to do it... I cant pay you a ton.. cause your stacking boxes. But hes helping these people out big time. If you are stacking boxes in an Amazon factory chances are you dont have many other options. Not there is anything wrong with that at all.. But thank Mr. BEzo"
2447,"The free market isn't necessarily free. Once corporations have enough wealth they can effectively corner the market and make it nigh impossible for any real competitors to challenge them. Google is a nice example. Since they have so much money and influence, people will ultimately end up being forced to use their services, like YouTube. Try to think of how many times you've used YouTube versus how many times you've used some other similar service. I wouldn't even be surprised to hear that you've never used anything else, because that's just the free market."
2448,"In San Francisco, a 1 bed 1 bath apartment is about 1000 dollars a month which is 12000 per year already. Then if we assume that they spend 10 dollars per meal with 3 meals per day with no snacks in between that's another 11000 dollars bringing us to a current total of 23000 spent. Factor in a car and gas or kids, you would be well over 30000, even though most Amazon workers make less than that at around 28000."
2449,"Everyone does have a shot, but they won't be able to achieve it since the ultra-rich get to do whatever they want without consequence since they are able to bribe the government into bending to their every will and allowing them to pay these workers too little to survive and therefore not allowing them to advance up the societal pyramid that you oh so adore. On another note, those billionaires never gave anybody anything, but instead they take all the credit after paying others to do the dirty work for them."
2450,"I think you've gone off on a very unrelated tangent that has nothing to do with anything.  

I also shop at Wal-Mart more than I shop anywhere else.  What does that have to do with you or anyone else becoming successful and rich?"
2451,Who runs San Francisco? Democrats. San Francisco is a literal shit hole. Ur literally allowed to poop in the streets.
2452,Wrong. President Trump is a billionaire and he does so much for people. You're just a soy boy who is upset with your own life so u blame on it how the world is. No one is gonna come save you. You gotta stop being such a fruit cake and make shit happen for yourself. I'd rather fail on my own then have a man made government act as my parent and take care of me. Fuck that.

A judge allowed Flynn docs released to the public yesterday. It also said he was helping Mueller with crimes of other people. I did not see names of who those people were.
2458,What the OP is talking about is the release of the Flynn docs released to the public yesterday. It was all over this sub yesterday. It does not look like Flynn was doing any favors for Trump or his administration.

Most of the population are not engaged/aware of everything that’s happening on the ground. They only go by the narrative fed to them by the MSM.

Most of the population have not taken the time to meditate and reflect upon the state of our society, and the problems that ail us. The conditions that have allowed things to come to such a pass.

You can’t let *their*  injustice move you to meet them in kind, with more injustice. You need to articulate your ideas in a convincing, intelligent way, and differentiate yourself from those who resort to the behaviour of animals. Only then will the sleeping masses distinguish between light and dark.

If I were you I would take the time to research your own hypothesis and maybe along the way you could confirm or in this case deny your own claim before making yourself look stupid. But if your anything like the person I think you are you dont have the patience nor the elementary quality of a person who thinks twice."
2793,"He never called his daughter sexy, he was calling her beautiful, it's perfectly ok for a father to call his daughter beautiful. Also joe biden has been caught on video touching kids in a sexual way. Donald trump has not raped or sexually assaulted anyone, the media lies because they hate him, and even leftist politicians lie about him just because they hate him. I can understand disagreeing with someone, but it's retarded to hate someone just because you don't like what they believe. Even trump supporters get attacked just because they support trump, there are several videos that prove that."

2798,"I think this is a valid question. If you watch a lot of MSM spin I could see how you may find his comments outrageous. Im surprised how toxic this sub got so quickly when we usually pride ourselves on presenting facts and making valid arguments rather than ridiculing people and name calling those who disagree with you. So to politely answer your question,

""Grab them by the pussy"". IMO Trump was referencing the fact that when you are rich, women throw themselves at you. They will let you do practically anything to them because they want a piece of you. They are basically groupies. They will let you grab them by the pussy. Hes not wrong. Women who surround themselves by rich men are willing to do provacative things if they think they can get to your money or to the extra perks. Just look at Hollywood. Trump says he just grabs women and kisses them and he can't help himself. When I listen to the tape, I hear dry sarcasm. I don't think the media is smart enough to distinguish sarcasm from truth and they take everything at face value. Especially if they can use it to disparage competition.  Trump likes women and has spent the better half of his life enjoying them. Is it surprising that a iconic billionaire enjoys the women that come his way. If a raunchy private conversation disqualifies you from being president then I doubt any of us will ever be qualified. 

Trump says if he wasn't related to Ivanka he might date her. You watch this video, everybody is laughing yet they all get so upset later. What false outrage. Trump doesn't always have the most tact when speaking. Of all the thing I love about him, it isnt that he is a connisseur of words. But, what I think Trump is trying to convey is that he is proud if his daughter. She is smart, beautiful, a great catch and any man would be lucky to have her. I don't think he is saying he is sexually attracted to his daughter. If he was, Ivanka probably would not have grown up to be as well rounded as she is and so close to her father. He cracked a joke and got chasstised for it. Remember Trump wasn't a polictician. He's not trained in double speak and to dance around questions and never really answer them. He doesn't have his list of talking points for every interview he does. Hes raw. And in private life when you say something akward it doesn't follow you forever. 

Sexual assult accusations. This kind of thing happens all the time to people with money and notoriety. Trumps not the first, he won't be the last. I don't follow the ""believe all women"" mantra. Im sorry, I just don't. Women lie, we can be vindictive, coniving, selfish and manipulative. If we believe every women claiming to be a victim we could easily destroy any mans life, career and marriage with a baseless accusation. Which is what the left is trying to do with the #me too movement. It also undercuts real victims of assult. I believe in due process. Unless you have creepy videos of yourself out there touching children inappropriately like Joe Biden."

Everything he did was based on nonviolence! Everything!  I think the left actually wants to destroy his legacy because King wanted equality, not benefits.   He strictly promoted nonviolence and love while the left wants to further destabilize the black population instead of encouraging productive citizens.   The black community in disarray is very useful to them.  Dr. King did great things, with a few not so great things.   But I will never believe he promoted rape.  Ever.  This is full out character assassination.

Illegal aliens abuse the tax code at refund season by having their own tax Id numbers, as opposed to us citizens with SSNs, where they claim child tax credits that pays out a few billion a year in refunds;
Illegal aliens commit identity fraud, take blue collar jobs while dealing primarily in cash, off the books;

2972,"They already are restricted, heavily restricted.  I have one in .22 rimfire caliber; took $$$ and lots o'time before ATF approval to purchase came through.  BATF tax and filing cost more than the suppressor itself.  Funny thing, in the UK where firearms ownership is extremely onerous, you can walk into a shop and buy a suppressor right over the counter.  The UK considers it a health-related accessory to prevent hearing loss and public nuisance.  Go figure.

To purchase a suppressor in the US, these are the hoops/restrictions you have to go through:

1. Be a resident of a state where suppressors are legal

2. Be at least 21 years of age

3. Be legally allowed to purchase a firearm

2973,"It’s sad honestly and I’m really hopeful that Trump attacks the unconstitutional 2A laws and regulations during his second term. After all this hoax conspiracy coup stuff is over. 

The 2A is the absolute most important thing We The People have to remain free. That is why it’s under attack. Really it is up to us to produce and distribute weapons among our community. Look at how even the most conservative law enforcement officers will infringe on 2A rights with no hesitation. Confiscating weapons which are open carried legally at gun point and hostility. We need to promote a culture of refusal to disarm. Refusal to infringe on citizen’s 2A rights by police and refusal to allow any regulations or restrictions on weapons to be enforced."
2974,"Agreed. It’s one offhand comment in an interview in response to a stupid question. Not to mention that the media absolutely exaggerated the benefits of the suppressor. Suppressors are wildly misunderstood thanks to Hollywood portrayals of them making firearms silent. In reality, taking a gunshot from 145dB to 115 or so doesn’t make it silent, so for the media to claim it increased lethality somehow is incorrect. But it’s not surprising that the media is full of falsehoods."

I mean almost all. there are appx 330 million Americans not including tourists, immigrants, and illegals. Only 5-7 million people watch cable news on any given night...………………. think about that.... Sad, huh? This is why they are the way they are - they know we know theyre dumb, theyre guilty of mass/multiyear government corruption coverup, and their tricks don't work anymore because of the internet. Eventually, the truth comes out... always. To answer you question, it is not just Trump, it is everything they think they can control, but don't, including us. I mean, listen... really listen to some of these people some time... they're fucking stupid. Fox has one... ONE.. singe intelligent host - Maria Bartiromo. The rest are worthless and programmed. CNN... **insert uncontrollable laughter here** they need not even be mentioned and MSNBC... The best they got is Jim Cramer on the CNBC business network... MSNBC is as stupid as CNN... but not as brazenly stupid. Fox is stupid, but they at least try the hardest to cover it up, lol."

They arrived in early 2013 to help the French military that had intervened in neighboring Mali the year before. The French had moved into Mali after an Al Qaeda affiliated group and tribal groups took over the vast northern part of the country and were moving toward the capital of Mali. As part of the U.S. effort to assist that mission then-President Barack Obama ordered 150 U.S. military personnel to set up a surveillance drone operation over Mali that would fly from Niger's capital of Niamey."

3023,"We need to start informing people about the difference between Zionists and Jews.  There’s a big difference folks.  In very broad strokes, we were all told because German economy was in such shambles following WWI and the restrictions imposed on them for their role in the War.   Following years of stagnation the German people were desperate for things to improve economically and socially.  Enter Adolf......a relative unknown with a God given talent for communication.  Leveraging the angst running rampant through the country, the browbeaten populace found their savior.   From that point forward Adolf’s rise was meteoric until the end.  

Ever wonder how Adolf was able to take over the country?  Rhetoric aside, how did Adolf do it?   MONEY, lots of Money.  Wait a second, if the country was in such terrible shape, the money must have come from outside, which it did.  

So who was the money?   Who financed Adolf?   Answer: Rothschild’s.  (aka Zionist).

3256,These people have decided to take a MASSIVE cut in pay and knowingly entered Government at a time when the deranged crybaby left have become completely unhinged.

yeah it's called business. most business is done outside the office especially on golf courses, he meets with dignitaries, foreign leaders and discusses policy over a friendly game."
3266,"So of his 871 days in office are you implying he has been in the White House 725 days of them or implying he has been away from the White House 725 days.

My guess would be the former. However that would also imply that Obama only spent 328 days in the WH. I think all of these numbers are fudged."
3267,WTF do those numbers mean?
3268,Lies. That number is bullshit.
3269,"You did an oopsie, Trumps done more good for the country than Obama and Bush. You’re gonna have to be a little smarter before you make a post like this again"
3270,Also going to the southern Whitehouse doesn't really count as vacation.
3271,"Maybe if he wasn’t being spied on inside the White House with his private calls and meetings being leaked, he wouldn’t have to find a way to circumvent that. By the way, he’s only been in office for 871 days. At least try posting a semi-believable number.  Also, traveling doesn’t = vacation."
3272,"You'd better do some recalculations here. These numbers don't add up. 3 x 365 is 1095 and he won't be three years in office until 1/20/20. That's 891 days in office as of today. So he has only been actually working in the White House and the Oval for 166 days? MMMM MMMMM! If you're saying he accomplished all that he has in 166 days then he works miracles, especially since he spent two and a half years with Traitor RINO Ryan as Speaker, the Mueller witch hunt, the Deep State, the crooked judges the loony Dims and the Fake News going for his throat."

He is fighting his own deep state, and his deep state was behind 9/11. And since Trump has business dealings with him that go back decades, he is well aware of this.

SUV and punching him by withdrawing his gun because he could not access less lethal weapons
while seated inside the SUV. Brown then grabbed the weapon and struggled with Wilson to gain
control of it. Wilson fired, striking Brown in the hand. Autopsy results and bullet trajectory,
skin from Brown’s palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brown’s DNA on the inside
of the driver’s door corroborate Wilson’s account that during the struggle, Brown used his right
hand to grab and attempt to control Wilson’s gun. According to three autopsies, Brown
sustained a close range gunshot wound to the fleshy portion of his right hand at the base of his
right thumb. Soot from the muzzle of the gun found embedded in the tissue of this wound
coupled with indicia of thermal change from the heat of the muzzle indicate that Brown’s hand
was within inches of the muzzle of Wilson’s gun when it was fired. The location of the
recovered bullet in the side panel of the driver’s door, just above Wilson’s lap, also corroborates
Wilson’s account of the struggle over the gun and when the gun was fired, as do witness
accounts that Wilson fired at least one shot from inside the SUV. ](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf)

Also tax revenue is higher and more taxes are actually being paid after the cut.  You see we believe in small government that’s there to defend our big R rights granted by god.

I can also say I do not entirely agree with many things Hitler had done himself, despite some of the good that had come with his ruling. Hitler did a lot of things that were very disagreeable for many. I would not say he was entirely bad, because no one person is entirely bad, but when it comes down to it, he did a lot of very damaging things that seem psychotic while in a position of great power. We do not wish for a repeat in a mass genocide of many peoples, totaling to somewhere over 11 million, including the 6 million Jews often quoted. We do not expect Trump to do entirely that, but rather, looking for traits that we find disagreeable, have shown up in history, and are potential hazards to look for in a leader.

&#x200B;

I will say the one thing I disagree with on this entire post is saying Trump has done nothing in power. He has done a lot, some good, some bad. I have also seen and heard many of the things Trump has done, and some of his statements are entirely disgusting. No one leader is perfect, but I thought that there were better candidates that could have been elected. I also know that in his position, I would have no clue what to do, so there is still a slight respect for taking on a task I would never put upon myself.

I will give you that Trump allows abortion in specific cases of rape or incest, and that he has not cracked down on gun control as severely as Hitler, but we also never claimed that he was a totalitarian dictator. We simply drew some interesting similarities on some of Trump's ideologies and how he handles them. 

&#x200B;

I would also debate that Trump uses similar mob mentality, which is why so many people in recent years have been so against illegal immigration, even in cases of asylum. I understand that some illegal immigrants are unsafe, but perhaps we should make it easier for people to seek asylum within our country,as many are just escaping troubled lives, especially for their children.

This implies that even undocumented or illegal immigrants have some rights to at least some protection while in the US, despite the mentality that has been often set that all are awful, horrible people. I am also good friends with someone who has illegal immigrant parents, but I have met his mother and all of his siblings who technically have citizenship under the 14th amendment, and they are very lovely, kind calm people. I promise you that they did not bring an inkling of drugs, but were simply seeking to escape hardships in Mexico, with family and with the general conflicts that had been going on. It was unsafe and they wanted safety for their family. The dad also became a citizen, and the mom is studying hard in school and at becoming a citizen, despite being incredibly poor."
3688,"I would like to point out as well, the mob mentality is not only evident with racial issues, but also with political party affiliations. I have heard it on both sides, I myself have witnessed and taken offense to being called things like a ""lib-tard,"" even though I am age 16. I have heard and witnessed many slurs on both sides, and quite honestly, more than anything, I just want healthy debate with facts. I am not here to make enemies. I have friends with both political affiliations within my school and out, and I think it is important to tackle issues with a civil response.

This was meant to be a meme, with a dark humor usage, to draw out similarities between the Nazi Party leader and our current president. I am not here to attack him, despite my disagreement with him. He has done a couple of things I approve of as well, I just overwhelmingly disagree with a lot of what he has said and done."

If tariffs only hurt us, why does China keep retaliating against them?"

3894,lol wrong
3895,"Hey numb nuts, if you knew your history, you’d know that the US used tariffs for 95-100% of Federal Funding. 

In fact, tariffs were used INSTEAD of having to have a federal income tax, but the Democrats fixed that for us in 1913. 

“Industrial workers had much higher wages than their European counterparts, and they creditied it to the tariff and voted Republican.”

(Paul H. Tedesco, Patriotism, Protection, and Prosperity: James Moore Swank, the American Iron and Steel Association, and the Tariff, 1873–1913 (Garland, 1985.)

[WRONG - More Than 600 U.S. Companies Sign Letter In Support Of Trump’s Tariffs](https://www.scribd.com/document/414075133/Country-First-Letter#from_embed) 

But heaven forbid you suspend your hate for Orange man for 2 fucking minutes to understand the history of, or how tariffs work. 

Dipshit."
3896,"The country was originally funded by tariffs, not taxes, taxes on US citizens is unconstitutional."
3897,Tariffs only hurt you if you buy Chinese trash. Tariffs make the Chinese trash the same price as the american made products. Trump doesnt tell you what to spend your money on and force you to buy Chinese shit.
3898,"Trump has been very clear about this. He wants reciprocal trade deals, not our fake ""free trade"" deals that are loaded with thousands of exceptions, tariffs and NTBs, almost always to Americas disadvantage. He's been leveraging Americas economic clout and using tariffs to force other countries to reduce their tariffs. So yeah, I support it."
3899,Wrong sub.
3900,"'Member when the U.S.'s budget was funded by tariffs?  I don't 'member 'cause it was a long time ago and i wasn't born yet, but history is a thing and that's what happened.

&#x200B;

I really don't like any kind of taxes but I'd rather fund the government with tariffs  than pay an  income tax, which is theft.

&#x200B;

Maybe the federal government has gotten too fucking big and we need to stop feeding it."
3901,"Why do people support paying billions to foreign countries and in return get nothing and lost money in a unfair trade balance practice that's been going on for decades. 

Example: Asian cars can be sold in the U.S. with no restrictions. U.S. cars going to Asian countries must have all their information on U.S. cars in English only. Can only be repaired in the country of origin. If you only understood your native language would you buy something you knew nothing about nor the dealer selling it, the answer would be no..."
3902,Because the rest of the world needs to sell their stuff to us A LOT more than we need to buy it.
