212,Oh so the proof is 'upcoming'.  Sounds like every other claim and conspiracy theory that's been made about Trump for the past year.
213,That is how an investigation works. Trump is alleged to have obstructed justice and Mueller will present the evidence he finds to Congress.

325,"This is so obvious that it's barely a ""prediction"", but give it a week and Trumpers will start saying that Democrats are using Trump and Russia to deflect from Clinton's Ukraine scandal. They seem to think chronology is negotiable. 

It's like when Democrats revealed high ranking officials of the Trump administration met with Russian benefactors and Trump tweeted that Susan Rice illegally wiretapped him to find that out. Which is absurd in and of itself, but the bizarre thing was that they then started claiming that Democrats were using Russia to deflect *from* the Susan Rice ""scandal."" As if it somehow doesn't matter that chronologically the accusation of Russian conspiracy came before the Susan Rice ""scandal."" Somehow the Russian conspiracy accusation was in retaliation to the Susan Rice ""scandal."""

389,I think Sanders time would be better used grooming a new generarion of political leaders that share his vaules and ideals 
390,I'm OK with it as long as he has an acceptable VP.
391,Here's how Bernie can still win...
392,Surely the Dems have someone in their 40s or 50s who is progressive and charismatic.  I'm tired of our Gerontocracy.
393,"To be honest, I would have to see the primary candidates before voting for Bernie again. But in the general it'd be an obvious choice over Trump"
394,"If he wins the primary, I'll vote for him, but I won't vote for him in the primary."
395,"He is gonna run, he is gonna win and there is nothing that can stop him, Bernie 2020!"
396,"Please no.

If he switches from (I) to (D) to run and then gets beat out by someone more moderate, I can see 2016 happening again."
397,Haters on here. He's exactly what we need.
398,is he going to fold like an accordion again? 
399,Pearls before swine.
400,The republicans would love it. 
401,This is old news. WILL HE RUN IN 2024!?
402,"Kamala Harris... or someone of her ilk. We need diversity, and as much as I liked Sanders he's old as bricks and a white guy. "
403,"I'm sure he would do some good. The question is would he want to spend those 4-8 years dealing with the mess caused by the Trump administration.? I'm not only referencing the fact that he isn't a young man anymore, but also because he seems to be so fed up with what's going on lately that it would cause a premature stroke or something. 

I think Dems need a new champion. Sort of like how France now has Macron- who is full of energy, ideas and fervor. I'm sure Bernie could offer some very wise advice, but in the end, we need someone young, empowered and progressive to wade through the murky waters that are now America and enhance our diplomatic relations, etc."
404,Bernie would be like 80 there is no way.  
405,"I'm anti-Trump but at this point I could never support Bernie or Hillary, it's time for new blood. Give me an intelligent patriot that knows how to get things done FOR the people, and I'll give you my vote. "
406,Bernie.. dude. You are too old. You done good. Pls stahp.
407,Way too old. We need young leaders.
408,I like Bernie but no. He'd be well into his 80s if he won a second term. That's just too old. 
409,If he doesn't pass away first

He'll still bring in the crowds and bring his integrity and honesty to the top of the ticket while at the same time removing the legitimate concerns over his age.  I see that as the best path right now.  

Perhaps putting his hat in the ring initially in the primaries but bowing out early and throwing his support behind someone else."
415,"He seems like he's in great shape now and he's holds the highest favorability rating of any senator in state and nationally. I trust that he'll pick a VP that would push his agenda if his health were to collapse. He's also stumping harder against the corporate stranglehold that American politics is currently stuck in more than anyone else, and there's nothing more important to me than that. I guess I can see how age is a concern to a certain extent, but to be a determining factor on whom should run seems kind of trivial to me. 

Frankly, the replies in this thread are pretty discouraging for my future hopes right now, in that talks of ""age"" and ""needing new blood"" dominate the discussion, rather than any discussion whatsoever about policy and the direction that the next leader of the democratic party should take. That should always be the dominating point in political discussion - who's got the best ideas that's going to help us the most? When it comes to that question, Bernie is a clear frontrunner. I would happily back another democrat who's pushing as hard for progressive reform in this country as he is, but they've gotta step up to the plate!

When I think of the country's leading progressive democrats, they're all over 65 (Warren, Franken, Wyden). I had been thinking Jeff Merkley might be a good pick based on his politics and being slightly younger, but he may be a bit too calm and mellow to take on a guy like Trump. I'm glad that Gillibrand came out in favor for Medicare for All today, though, that's the kind of change that progressives want to see in future party leaders."
416,"That's part of what running for President does.  It gets your ideas out there.  And if you win, you can get your ideas out there even more.

Bernie would be a pretty great president regardless."

422,"They have dems in there 40s and 50s, they have progressives, and they have charismatic politicians.  But someone that meets all three of those?  Probably not in senate or any governors.  We'll see how Harris does in the next three years, she has potential but is still relatively inexperienced and doesn't yet have much of a following for any particular political movements.  I don't think Booker has a chance, he's too corporate for progressives to get behind.  Gillibrand will likely be plagued by basically being Hillary's protege.  There may be some options in congress, but the only national face in congress atm is Nancy Pelosi, so a person from congress would have to pull off a major feat going from unknown to nationally recognized in the relatively short primary.  If Pelosi were to step aside, however, and allow a younger progressive to lead, we might be able to set someone up for 2020.  This is probably our best option for a charismatic young progressive to be groomed for the presidency.

But if we ignore the age limitation, I think Bernie, Warren or Franken would all be strong contenders.  They could pick a young progressive to be their VP, and set them up for a run in 2024 (no one said we need the same person to be president for two terms). "
423,*coughcoughCoryBooker*
424,"That's reasonable, but it's too early to tell what the field will look like. I doubt he would have considered running at all in 2016 if somebody like Elizabeth Warren had run. 

Sanders entered the race probably too late as it was. Chances are we'll have a strong enough set of candidates that Sanders won't feel the need to jump in again but I don't blame him for keeping the door open."
425,Didn't that already happen? 
426,"Yeah, I think we are all just done with the whole Bernie crowd even more than him. "
427,Except in 2020 the super delegates will support the more progressive candidate that had the best chance of winning in a head to head.  Politically the democrats would be worse off if they had control of the presidency right now which is why they supported the weaker candidate.  2018 is a brutal election for the democrats if they control the presidency now.  So many seats in the senate would have been lost for 6 years.   Now everything is lining up for 2020 to be the year of progressive hindsight

As it pertains to last election, I'm one of the many Bernie supporters who preferred Trump over Hillary.  If only slightly.  

If the DNC hadn't conspired with the Hillary Campaign and media to ensure a Hillary win, then we would be talking about President Sanders right now.

President Sanders would be receiving a similar level of vitriol and attacks as Trump currently gets as well, as he's an uncorrupt outsider who fights for the people rather than the establishment corporatist oligarchy.  The corporatist media hates politicians like that.  "

Frankly, a Bernie stump is more enthusiastic and exciting than any speech I've seen from any other dems.  There's a reason why he holds the biggest rallies in the country right now.  Whomever the nominee is, I'd like them to be willing to bold, angry, and unrestrained, and willing to take on the donor/corporate class.  Hillary was to nervous to do so, and the walking on eggshells throughout the campaign really hurt her authenticity.  I'm not confident that Booker, Gillibrand or even Harris would be any different, but I am hopeful that this will change for all of them."

573,"[FCC’s Net Neutrality Rules](https://www.cato.org/blog/fccs-net-neutrality-rules):

>These issues are not new.  In fact they first arose between railroads and the creators of “content” i.e. farmers, mines, steel mills etc. in the 19th century.  The political resolution of these issues was the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.  It took about one hundred years for the experiment in transportation common carrier rate regulation to end.  Scholars have concluded that rate regulation raised rather than lowered transportation prices.  And the public has come to the same conclusion because in the quarter century since the end of transportation rate regulation, prices have decreased dramatically.  For a discussion of the rise and fall of transportation regulation see [this article](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2002/7/v25n2-3.pdf) by Thomas Gale Moore.

>In “Antecedents to Net Neutrality” Bruce Owen [explicitly makes the link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2007/7/v30n3-3.pdf) between the concerns of traditional transportation common carrier regulation and the contemporary notion of “Internet neutrality.”  Net neutrality policies could be implemented only through detailed price regulation, an approach that failed to improve consumer welfare in the transportation sector. History thus counsels against adoption of most versions of net neutrality.  Christopher Yoo [has written](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2370068) a detailed history of how difficult common carriage regulation was to implement in traditional telecommunications regulation.  A shorter version will appear in the summer issue of Regulation."
574,">The bottom line is that they make surface level reasonable arguments regarding neutrality without addressing monopolies, criteria, competitiveness or access.

575,We were fine before.
576,"*peers at list* 

*sees dates before 2015*. 

Yep, it was definitely threatened by anti-net neutrality activists before 2015.

MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products.

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments."

I read this part. He can make his case about railroads.  Railroads are somewhat similar in that many were federal land grants where as utilities are public easements.

If we stop treating this utility as a utility it attacks the freedom that Cato says it supports. 

Cato is two-faced over this just as they are over big military budgets and ""fiscal responsibility."" Let some Republicans say he hates spending BUT he'll sock billions into the next failed aircraft and Cato people will empty their pockets for him.

But let us be the adults in the room and guarantee the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity - not the curse of debt slavery and now Cato lines up with the slave owners?

580,"You can't genuinely be comparing Title II regulation to the regulation of transportation in the late 1800s to mid 1900s. Also Christopher Yoo is a well-known shill for the telecom industry so his arguments don't impress me much.
>Cristopher Yoo came under scrutiny in 2014 while testifying in favor of Comcast's $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable. During testimony, Yoo claimed that the merger likely would not hurt customers. David Cohen, a Comcast executive, is chairman of the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania where Christopher Yoo teaches, which is a potential conflict of interest for Yoo. Additionally, Yoo serves as the founding director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition which performs independent research aimed to shape the way legislators think about technology policy. This organization has also been criticized for existing primarily to further the agenda of large technology corporations. Among the list of companies that donate to the organization are: AT&T, Comcast, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Charter Communications, and Verizon."

"
584,">Christopher Yoo is a well-known shill for the telecom industry

I'm not sure what this means. He holds positions that he thinks are valid - aren't people on the other side of the issue ""shilling"" for it as well?

In regard to the Comcast merger, he told WaPo: ""The views of any other person in the university administration do not have any impact on my academic views or any public statements I make."" Is there some proof you have to offer that his views *are not* his own?

>Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition which performs independent research

Well, the center is at the university at which he is employed and he's only one of several primary faculty members. There are also a few secondary faculty members. Are they all ""shills""? And you already highlighted the fact that it does *independent* research. Here's their mission:

>CTIC is dedicated to promoting foundational research that will shape and reshape the way legislators, regulatory authorities, and scholars think about technology policy, intellectual property, privacy, and related fields.

They state exactly what they do right there. I'm not sure how that's surprising or why that would be considered ""shilling"" as many (if not all) research centers have similar mission statements."
585,Net neutrality hasn't been in effect since the birth of the Internet...

588,Laying a mile of Fiber vs a mile of rail are too very different things. This is a stupid argument that honestly highlights a deep lack of knowledge on how the Internet and the hardware behind it works.

I recommend reading Eleanor Norton's dissent from a couple months ago, when the FCC decided to move forward with its reevaluation of Title II. It deals with many of the arguments Woo makes. 
  
 
  
But honestly, even if you knew nothing about Woo, his statement that the Time Warner merger would have no adverse effects on consumers should immediately  set off alarm bells.

596,[deleted]
597,"> I'm guessing that's a rural or remote area? How do you think NN would help in your having better Internet service?

When you are the only shop in town, and have no rules governing the QOS (that's quality of service) then the answer to make more money is to do things like impose data caps  and speed caps vs innovating in helpful areas that benefit the customer and the provider. It incentives laziness and monopolies. They treat the area like gang turf and then they use the money to lobby local governments heavily to keep competition out of the area. "
598,"> Yea, what a disaster it's been for us all so far.

This is how you started. NN had nothing to do with you - up to now - not having to pay for Internet packages or whatever else you think, since it's rules have only been in effect a very short time.

And in the entire history of the Internet, no ISP or other entity has grown from the idea of having ""Internet packages"" that restrict users access to applications or websites. So, that fear is totally unfounded. (There have been ""walled gardens"", but that's not what you're talking about.)"
599,">innovating in helpful areas that benefit the customer and the provider.

Again, how does NN help innovation that the current state of affairs can't provide? Before net neutrality we saw great innovations in applications like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, &tc. and we also saw in the early days companies like AOL bringing millions of people to the Internet through integrated services. "

601,"How can you not extrapolate out the answer from what I just wrote. Millions of people still don't have access to decent speeds to take advantage of all these services. That's the problem. At some point you need to secure access and fairness for the the rest of the people not just the wealthy and well connected. The counter ask to you is how are these regulations going to stop these innovations? HTML isn't a new tech the speed and the access to leverage it is what is making all the magic. If I'm a kid in bum fuck Alabama who is smart and has a capacity to learn to be a great world changing coder but can't access Github at a decent click to store collaborate with my peers, or watch Youtube to learn new techniques, download the tools I need, etc etc etc.. that's lost innovation. All your examples listed above came from people at their time being able to leverage connectivity to make something awesome. I don't understand why this is so hard for you grasp.. the more people you get on the web with good solid connections.. the more innovation  you will see.. not less. Verizon didn't make FB.. Verizon didn't make Netflix.. Verizon didn't make e-mail.. they didn't make Slack.. they didn't make Instagram.. well connected people did. Counter that with say current network cable TV and the turd sandwich that has become.. and that's all because few people worked to hold the keys to the kingdom for so long. Same with mainstream music.. I could go on and on. These artificial barriers to entry that come with industry have never make things go faster and in fact that's the last thing they want to happen honestly. "
602,"> Ending it means some companies/sites get the ""fast lane"" and others don't.

Going with your argument, if it has been de facto neutral all along, then it cannot be ended by not implementing new regulations. What you're suggesting will happen hasn't ever happened.

(And it hasn't really been neutral, companies have still been subject to many anti-trust, commerce, and FCC laws even without NN.)

>Be for ending NN if you want

I'm against letting an incompetent government having any more regulatory access to our *entire* Internet infrastructure."
603,">How can you not extrapolate out the answer from what I just wrote. 

You're still not answering the question. How does net neutrality provide for better services and/or speeds?

And how does it do in a way that's not available currently without it?

>At some point you need to secure access and fairness for the the rest of the people not just the wealthy and well connected. 

This argument assumes that the Internet is a *right* and not a *service*. I don't think that's valid.

Also many people besides ""the wealthy"" have access to the Internet.

>The counter ask to you is how are these regulations going to stop these innovations? 

No, the counter is that we've had innovations without NN all along, so why do we need it now?"

707,Whatabbout what about whattabouttism.
708,"Oh! Some tenuous whataboutism from 20 years ago! Why didn't someone say something? Better stop worrying everyone, case closed."
709,"Deflect! Deflect!

Such a stupid bullshit article from a stupid trash rag."
710,This story will surely be the one to direct all the attention off of Trump's crimes.
711,The cracks in your whataboutisms are starting to show. Better come up with a new tactic.
712,We expect certain nations to attempt to undermine us and our interests as we do to them too.  What we don't expect is American's to facilitate those actions.  
713,"And Russians in Russia helped us do it, and Russia really shouldn't have any problem with that? Is that the rest of the argument?"
714,Great point! Japan really should drop two atomic bombs on US cities!
715,"So, what?  Because the US attempted this stuff in the 60's it's perfectly fine for Russia to do it to us now or something?  Is that the message here?"
716,"*Of course, the MSM is ignoring the clear evidence that Hillary Clinton is guilty (very guilty) of...* I can't not read this in Trumps voice."
717,"Look, it shouldn't be news that either of us are hacking the other; it's business as usual. 

That outrage is completely misplaced; where it needs be directed is specifically at those in our government who were complicit in allowing an effective compromise *at all* much less encourage it in the interest of benefitting their party.
"
718,"There was a similar Time issue praising the rigging of Iranian elections. It's completely reasonable to be mad about election interference, even to take diplomatic action against it, but it's a severe case of selective memory to not recognize that all the major powers are doing this, it should be expected and defended against, not lamented over."
719,Conservatives breathlessly justifying Russia's attacks against American institutions.  Hmmm...we are all the way through the looking glass.  Reagan is spinning.
720,"The CIA's primary activity is to ensure elections around the world benefit the USA.  The USA has interfered in Australia to make John Howard their man.  It wasn't the first or the last time, probably."
721,"I'm guessing that the Russians investigated the crap out of it, and severely punished the Russians responsible."
722,Yep. We also have spies in other countries. But what we do is a one way street. Is it hypocritical? Maybe. But that's how goverments operate. You work for your own government to help your country. You don't work for another government to disrupt your own countries sovereignty.
723,Remember that part of Catch 22 when Milo bombs his own airbase to destroy the cotton he overstocked and make money while his fellow Americans were wounded and killed? I think some Trumpsters would still back their God Emperor if he bombed certain parts of America.
724,"Check out this CSPAN video. This is one of the American Consultants that worked for the Yeltsin campaign re-election. It shows many parallels to the events over the last year or so.

725,"First of all, who is ""you guys""?  Bernie supporters?

Second of all, no I personally am 'not cool' with it

Third of all, I'm not ok with election interference, nor am I going to stop providing geopolitical perspective to the issue just because some guy on the internet tells me to.  "
726,"good to see that Whataboutism is attaining to meme-level societal awareness
"
727,"I mean, it should be obvious that it doesn't make it okay, but let's be fair, it's not like the US stopped doing it after the 1960s."
728,don't you know? 2 wrongs obviously make a right in cult 45 land!
729,"It is hypocritical. It's also hypocritical to put sanctions on North Korea for developing nuclear weapons when the U.S already has nuclear weapons. But that's how the world works: a country has to protect its position in the world even if that involves lying or being a hypocrite. Countries that don't hijack other countries' elections aren't motivated by morality. No, the reason why China didn't try to get in contact with Clinton or Trump is because they didn't want to deal with possible retaliatory acts from the U.S if their interference was discovered. However, if we don't punish Russia for what they've done, China (and plenty of other countries) might decide to get involved in our nect elections."
730,"So should we report it because it's out of date, or off topic? Your call. "
731,His psycho base likes it.  The rest of the 60% plus of the nation definitely does not.
732,What's his approval rating again? Doesn't look like people are liking it. 
733,"You know, you're right. They might. Let me check.

>[gallup.com](http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx)

Nope! No they don't! Boy howdy do they not! Whew!"
734,38% approval rating. I think only his sister fucking fanbase like his childish antics.
735,"The majority does not and did not. Clinton won the popular vote and Trump's popularity has been dropping since then. So, no, most Americans find Trump's antics deeply troubling because they only mean there's a moronic lunatic as President."
736,Its like being the tallest midget
737,You guys need your own sub where you can keep reposting this story all day long?
738,"I can't count how many variations of this article I've seen this week, along with the FBI investigation into Bernie articles."
739,"Oh, Bank Fraud Bernie?"
740,Pretty sure OP keeps reposting this story for that website.
741,Hysterical Tucker has no idea how to spin what is happening right now.
742,"It's ok, the head of the country was in the secret agency of which tried to suppress Eastern Europe for 40 years, but that's ok "
743,Says the Nazi apologist.
744,Tucker Carlson - delighted to support Russia if it helps the right wing agenda.  Such a patriot.
745,The right: let's be friends with Russia now guys!? Come on it's not that baddd? It's just a little locker room election interference! 
746,Tucker = the cock holster for Putin's cock holster
747,Weird.... someone tell Obama he's not a pussy anymore for not confronting Putin over Crimea. 
748,"fuck you tucker, you seditious fuck. "
749,It's definitely in the top 5.  I wonder what cold war senators would think of today's Republicans.
750,"The party of Reagan. Ha ha ha ha! 

What a joke!"
751,"Every time I see something like this coming out of Fox News, all I can think is . . . guys? You know there's a counterintel investigation going on, right? Has it occurred to you that they're pretty likely to start pulling the financial records of any person and any organization they see consistently parroting Russian propaganda? And how sure are you that your financials, and that of your multi-national employer, are going to withstand that scrutiny?"
752,"Who the fuck cares how bad Russia is or isn't? They screwed with a democratic election. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad, it doesn't matter if the US ""deserves"" it. You don't have to take action against Russia if that's the problem, but that's no excuse for not taking actions at home. Don't waste time yelling at Russia, just fix the damage and make sure it doesn't happen again."
753,"""Lock up Hillary Clinton, she made her emails vulnerable to Russian hackers!""

""Putin is really our friend, let's all just forget about that whole 'Russian thing'.""

Funny how putting yourself in a position to be vulnerable to Russian hackers is considered by some to be a criminal offense, but actually conspiring with Russian operatives to use those cyber attack efforts for political manipulation is totally acceptable."
754,Tucker is human trash 
755,They should hook Roland Reagan's corpse to the electrical systems with all the spinning it's doing we could probably have power for decades.
756,"I seem to remember their GOP deity Reagan calling them the ""axis of evil"" back in the 80s. "
757,The GOP hates fellow Americans more than foreigners trying to undermine our country

760,"I want to say his particular strain of douchebaggery regarding Trump-Russia will ruin his career henceforth, but unfortunately he's part of a right wing ~~media~~ **propaganda** juggernaut. "
761,Yep. The right is hysterical now. They're trying anything they can to get us to look elsewhere. 
762,"Totally chill. Also, this [list of journalists killed in Russia](https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia/) is nothing to be concerned about and certainly no reason to reflect on America's press-government relationship. "
763,"It's totally ok that he was caught red handed murdering innocent countrymen in their homes, leading to his ascention to power, and starting a war that went on to kill untold more innocent people.

If you haven't read about this I suggest you do, it is the most fucked thing Putin ever did, and is the root of his powe. Anyone you encounter who is a new found Russia appologist should probably be informed that they are supporting a terrorist. "
764,"last night he was telling some dude he didn't know shit about foreign policy because he had supported the Iraq War. 

the guy instantly called him out on it on his SO HAD Tucker lol.

he didn't care,  Tucker kept pushing it"
765,Imagine if they helped Clinton win and Chelsea was having secret meetings with Russian spies to get dirt on Trump.
766,Kinky.
767,He'll be so relieved.
768,"Please note the article says, ""of all time."" I wouldn't even have Russia in the top 50..."
769,"This is more an example of you and WittsandGrit having no idea how to spin what is happening right now.  The argument is that the US worked with, even helped Stalin when it was in our interests against Hitler.  Therefore there is nothing wrong with working with the Russians when it's in our interests to defeat ISIS."
770,They supported regimes in Eastern Europe that had fucking tanks driving on city streets during martial law. My mom had to experience that. Fuck that.
771,"The best is that this was published by the National Review, definitely not a part of the liberal lamestream media"
772,Partisans on the right would be literally calling for their executions.
773,Heads would explode.
774,Stalin killed more people than anybody except Mao.  I think it qualifies.
775,"But you'll notice that when we worked with Stalin we still didn't bend over backwards to suck his dick. Trump still refuses to say anything bad about Putin, refuses to accept that Russia and *only* Russia attacked our election, even suggested forming a cybersecurity taskforce with the nation that just performed an unprecedented attack on our election infrastructure."
776,"Lololololololol Hitler marching full-on armies into neighboring European countries =/= a dying ramshackle collection of violent lunatics committing cowardly acts of terrorism. Cute, though. 

How much do you get paid for this?"
777,"No spin necessary. This is turning into a beautiful example of Occam's Razor. Collusion has always been the simplest explanation, and now our suspicions are being confirmed. This has never been complicated."
778,lmao
779,Hahahahahaa!!!!!!!!!
780,Hahahahahahahaha! Breath... Hahahahahahahahaha!
781,I know I couldn't fucking believe that when I heard Tucker say it
782,"We did work with them (sort of) and we, and the allies were appalled at what the red army did as they marched on Berlin. Just the beginning of what we found to be abhorrent behavior on behalf of Russia. The war crimes were rival only to Germany. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes
"
783,"> The argument is that the US worked with, even helped Stalin when it was in our interests against Hitler. Therefore there is nothing wrong with working with the Russians when it's in our interests to defeat ISIS.

Lol.  I'd say you couldn't make this shit up but clearly someone did.  Unbelievable that people have so lost the art of thinking for themselves they can no longer detect when the talking points they're been fed are overtly, obviously, patently absurd.

This....this won't fly honey.  Nor will it float."
784,Comparing isis to Nazi Germany is ridiculous. No one knew how horrible Stalin really was until he was dead. 
785,"Are you really saying that ISIS are the new Nazis? ISIS can't even hold Syria, the Nazis took most of Europe. Never mind the fact that the alliance was made out of dire necessity and that Stalin killed millions (including political opponents and private dissenters). Never mind how we had a three decade cold war with Russia, which Putin never forgave us (the US) of coming out on top in. Equating the existential threat of ISIS to Nazis is just dumb. "
786,Technically a different country.
787,"Actually we did.  It took an act of congress, Stalin collaborators, obviously.  Propaganda was in place to show the ""Big three"" FDR, Churchill, and Stalin.  After the war even more negotiations took place regarding what would happen to Europe.  It didn't need to end in war between the sides and it never did.  It ended in negotiations.  Now we have some democrats gunning for that war that never happened, and never needed to happen."
788,"The best part is that the spin is now geared towards ""colluding with Russia is okay""..BUT... Don Jr was promised DAMAGING info that Hillary and the DNC were colluding with Russia. So basically he was colluding to expose colluding but colluding  (according to the spin) isn't really bad. So what the actual fuck? They cant have it all 3 fucking ways. I'm dizzy.    "
789,Bu...but..but Hitler and Hillary what about them..cries
790,"In name, yes.  They also prop up North Korea and other regimes hostile to the west.  "
791,"It ended in a massive, prolonged cold war that nearly brought us to the brink of mass extinction, and it indirectly led to this mess in the first place.

Fighting ISIS and punishing Russia aren't mutually exclusive. But since Trump is incapable of any degree of nuanced thought he thinks that the only way to prevent nuclear war with Putin is to constantly tongue-punch his asshole. And that, mind you, is the *absolutely most sympathetic* reading of the situation."
792,"here we go with the ""omgzzz the democrats are trying to start WWIII with Russia"" again.  Seriously, shut the fuck up with this garbage.  It is the most overly reactionary absurd bullshit I have ever heard.  Your entire argument hinges on the idea that we can either appease and please a country that just fucked with us and pretend it never happened (showing incredible weakness) or we have to literally go to war with them....there is a fucking ocean of space between those two viewpoints.  Stop spouting bullshit."
793,You must have learned your history at Trump University.
794,Conservative tactic; take something simple and muddy the waters until the facts become so obscured that people give up trying to assign blame. That's been a FOX News specialty for the past 20 years.
795,"you touch on how every trumpet argument goes:  this isn't bad..it is just like that thing Clinton did (it usually isn't) that we had a hissy fit about how it was so bad that you could NEVER allow somebody who does that to be president because that would be giving up America.

So...either all of your Clinton arguments (even if we take them at face value) were bullshit...or you are saying that Trump and co should be locked up because that would be the only way to be logically consistent.  

they are a funny bunch.  
"
796,IDK if I can trust your opinion though. Lavrov's dogs don't seem like an unbiased source here...
797,You guys need your own sub where you can keep reposting this story all day long?
798,"I'm a Bernie or buster (for reasons), but one thing that always bothered me is the idea that he wants to drain the swamp while simultaneously giving the swamp more power over us. Healthcare, college, minimum wage, regulations, taxes, he can acknowledge that our corrupt government is basically just a giant corporation selling favors to other corporations, but he still wants to give the oligarchy greater control and even more power. 

Can these two thoughts be reconciled? Does it require draining the swamp first? What happens in the future when Bernie isn't here and we have not a single true statesmen to fight for us? This kind of thing worries me because government does not shrink, so if Bernie sends us down this road, I can't see it turning out well for anyone but the lobbyists and the special interests that employ them.

edit: Wow, what's with all the downvotes? Is this not a compelling discussion? It's a question I've thought of quite a bit, so I'm a bit peeved at all the downvotes. Could somebody at least respond? "
799,It sounds like you are more of a libertarian than a liberal which means more freedom. Freedom from government is good.
800,"Bernie or Bust.

""If I don't get my way, I'm taking my ball and going home!"""
801,I'm opposed to voting for liars and criminals. I don't think that's such an egregious crime that we can't have a reasonable discussion. 
802,"Oh, my sweet summer child..."
803,Then why does he keep lying about it??
804,"Yeah, I mean, he only met with multiple Russian agents with multiple members of the Trump campaign, repeatedly lied about it, and continues to attempt to downplay what actually happened with mediocre excuses even as more facts come out. And don't we all, sometimes?"
805,[deleted]
806,[deleted]
807,"I had a Trump supporter tell me that it's perfectly fine for the president and his people to lie because they aren't under oath. 
 I guess they just lie for sport and not because they're hiding something. We're so fucked.  "
808,"Then why not just say everything?

You *know* the Russians recorded the shit out of it."
809,[deleted]
810,"Your deflection is sad, bro. "
811,"Ok Dennis, I have a thought exercise for you: 


Replace Russia with Iran.  After intelligence agencies conclude unanimously and with overwhelming confidence that Iran actively sought to undermine the integrity of our elections as a cyber-warfare operation - an intermediary then reaches out to a presidential political campaign, claiming to want set up a meeting with a Iran government spokesperson (remember, the emails presented the Lawyer as working for the Russian government, even tho she denies it) who claims to have illicit dirt on the campaign oppoent and want to meet to discuss how Iran can coordinate to support the candidates rise to power... The campaign says, ""I love it,"" in indication of an eagerness to work with Iran to influence the election, takes then meeting, then lies about it over and over and over.


Does it still sound like ""nothing"" to you Dennis?  


No campaign should receive anything of value from a foreign national, much less a foreign government.  The proper action for ""Russia"" just truly wanting to help expose something ""improper"" would be to turn that information over to US investigative agencies.  But of course that's not what an adversarial nation will do.  They will try to use it as the ""carrot"" to try and cultivate a relationship with people they can exploit. 


A campaign who receives such an invitation, should immediately report it to the FBI. 


There is a STAGGERING DIFFERENCE between opposition reasearch coordinated through conversations with other AMERICANS and CONSPIRING WITH A FOREIGN POWER TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION.


If democrats do it, they should be caught and prosecuted and run out of politics.


If republicans do it, they should be caught and prosecuted and run out of politics.


If representatives from Debbie's SuperSpecial Happy Friend Party do it, they should be caught and prosecuted and run out of politics. 


Why the FUCK is this a partisan issue?? 
"
812,"Great video clip. A Fox News contributor is ranting about how Akhmetshin is being labeled an agent of Russia despite being a naturalized citizen and all of the good work he has done in this country [citation needed]. ""I used to think that was un-American to do that to people based on where they were born."" How things have changed from 15 minutes ago when all naturalized citizens from predominantly Muslim countries are terrorists. Funny that the host was self-aware enough to not continue down that path."
813,"Kind of embarrassed to admit that I was a Kucinich fan way back in 2004. *(I was 16, okay? First election I was old enough to pay any real attention to...)*"
814,"""A bunch of nothing"" or ""nothingburger"" are two expressions of political thought. Prima facie they are oxymorons. People who use this expression are using a dog whistle of political allegiance, coupled with the power of mob mentality. These expressions are used in an echo chamber to reinforce and train the masses as to what to believe when truth has lost it's veracity. "
815,That's what you'd say if it wasn't nothing...
816,Pay no attention to the treason behind the curtain. 
817,Well shit. Guess that's all folks. The dude who believes he saw a UFO and decided to talk about that fact at a national debate thinks there's nothing here. Pack it up.
818,If it truly were nothing they wouldn't be devoting so much time repeatedly telling their viewers it is nothing. 
819,"Kicinich is a moron, is this not common knowledge?"
820,Only fools and Russian trolls believe Trump.
821,"I'll take ""Useful Idiots of the Left"" for 500, Alex."
822,"What the hell happened to Dennis Kucinich? He's lost his damn mind.  What a shame, as he used to be a good torchbearer for the progressives.  As somebody who went to see him speak on his doomed to fail run for the presidency, he's dead to me now."
823,Kucinich was alt-left before it was cool.
824,I think its cause the GOP is backed by foreign money.
825,And more and more people keeping showing up at this meeting.

827,The Elfmaster.

The WH is now also run by GRU. Their objective is to make US crash and burn, and they are successful. The US will end in civil war before the end of the term. No reason to tell anyone. "
829,"That's the problem right there, it's not the lies, it's the people who not only put up with them but defend them.

I expect a trump to lie, but before this past election I expected a little bit more from a vast majority of Americans."
830,What was their reasoning for impeaching Clinton then? 
831,"Kucinich was the most staunch and vocal adversary to the Bush regime pushing very similar ideology to what we're experiencing now.

I really value his opinion, actually."
832,Low energy.

834,Hell just look at what they did to our last president who was a naturally born citizen. 
835,I'll admit it too. I thought he was cool even up until he lost his primary and then joined Fox.

842,Simmer down now.
843,"And, for that matter, Chomsky has said the same"
844,Any sources? (Out of genuine curiosity)
845,Anything is possible at this point. I would be surprised if we find out Vlad and dumpy trump were at the meeting too.
846,... once you're IN Fight Club ....
847,"Not really. Chomsky just said the Russia thing is the least of America's concerns with regard to Trump and the current Republican party whom Chomsky says is, ""more dangerous for America than ISIS.""  "
848,I think he was on RT. 
849,"In the interview I watched, Chomsky said that the democrats were foolish for pursuing the Russian narrative when the more obviously destructive policies were right there for the Republicans to be taken to task on.

But he did say, that as someone who lived through the Cold War and the terrifying threat of nuclear annihilation, that it is not unreasonable to court Russia and attempt to keep relations civil.

I'm not totally sure I agree with his opinion, I just highly respect him and was surprised at the comment."
850,"yeah a lot of right wing media is taking his comment out of context and ignoring the part where he says america should still be terrified of trump and that it's only nothing compared to more pressing concerns. 

I get his point and all but I just can't get down with the idea of rolling over and appeasing russia, letting the trumps get away with this shit just because our government has done plenty of shady shit too.

851,He'll resign soon. 
852,"I think under ordinary circumstances this would be true. However, as long as Trump himself is in charge of the WH response & damage control, it will end sooner.

> Both expected the Nazis to attempt a coup, though their analyses of the situation were otherwise totally different. For the SPD, the expected Nazi uprising would be their signal to act without bearing the onus of illegality, as they had successfully done with a general strike against the “Kapp Putsch” of 1920, when Freikorps units had tried to take over the government. Given that frame of mind, they never identified an opportune moment for counteraction against Hitler.



> The communists followed a totally different logic, based upon their conviction that social revolution was at hand. In that perspective, Nazi success might actually help the communist cause by setting off a pen-dulum movement, first to the Right and then, inexorably, to the Left.

> KPD strategists, focused firmly on the coming revolution, saw SPD efforts to save Weimar democracy as “objectively” counterrevolutionary. They denounced the socialists as “social fascists.” Convinced that the SPD was no less their enemy than the Nazis and competing with the Nazis for the same volatile membership (especially the unemployed), the KPD even cooperated with the Nazis in a wildcat strike against the Berlin transport system in November 1932. The last thing the German communists were going to do was help the SPD save democratic institutions.

So, my issue here is that these statements, in effect depend on _a priori_ assumption that they are irrational. In a sense, you're saying they're irrational because they're defending their irrationality - basically, a circular argument. To the first line, you suggest empirical data as a contrast - i.e., you suggest that their views are _not_ supported by empirical data. Unfortunately, I've seen many cases with empirical data on both sides, so without some more clarification (e.g. _which views they have that are not empirically supported_), I find this unsubstantiated.

Now let's get to the more meaty statements:

> pedal identity politics and screech neoliberal at anyone...

> refuse to compromise

If I could refine that statement a bit, I think you're talking about people acting like propagandists - obstinately pushing one view, and labeling/name-calling at those who disagree instead of providing substantive rebuttal. I fervently oppose that as well - but, again in my experience, there are bad eggs in _every_ political subgroup, and they tend to be disproportionately vocal. Those who are _not_ bad eggs, when talking with you, may find that they see you the same way you see those bad eggs - ""screeching"", labeling, and not interested in substantive debate. In short, are you trying to solve the problem, or do your actions contribute to it?

> That was obvious when they ran around claiming Hillary Clinton was a conservative because she didn't 100% agree with every ... thing they tried pushing.

I would guess nuance is more important than the broad stroke here. Let me speak from my position a bit here: her record in Congress suggests that:

1. she is at heart pro-business (representative issues here might be TPP, and her [history of well-paid speeches and comfort with Wall Street](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speeches-wikileaks.html))
2. that her turns toward progressivism in her party platform aren't very sincere (as evidenced by [glowing endorsements of the same just before the campaign](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hillary-clinton-trade-deal-229381) contradicting her platform), and [her unwillingness to use her own platform in campaign advertising](http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/blog/2016-election-study-published/))

Even so, that doesn't mean that I believe she is more _economically_ conservative than the GOP, or that she is at all _socially_ conservative - both her record and her campaign reflect a strong push for protecting minorities and preventing discrimination against LGBTQ, etc.

At a more meta-level, I think many out there see the Democratic party as corrupt, and that they may vote Republican despite manifest/demonstrable corruption there because they think Democrats are worse, in terms of ""gaming minorities to help the rich"", etc. I don't throw this assertion _completely_ away out of hand, and I look for reasons why this can be seen as true. In particular, the [New Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats) movement does somewhat align with these assertions, and has also dominated party image/presence since the Clinton era. This suggests that, maybe, what the party is suffering from is the fatigue of continued dominance by this faction, and that new blood is needed.

How would you respond to this?"

Sure, 4% unemployment might be unreasonable - but, as has been noted elsewhere (don't have a link on hand, but probably not hard to find a good discussion about it) unemployment and underemployment may be significantly different. That said, I think the historical ""standard"" level has been 5% - but this feels more rule-of-thumb than theoretically-justified threshold. I'll believe 4% is too optimistic if we have concrete examples of economies trying for 4%, and _failing because 4% was too far_.

Regarding financial assistance for JP Morgan, yup - I've seen the same distortion as well, and the naive-sum total loan amount is both sensational and misleading - agreed that it doesn't help the argument at all.

Regarding qualification for the FOMC - agree with Sanders that concurrent or revolving-door service between bank and FOMC boards is a conflict of interest, and with the post writer that hiring unqualified people to the board is a risk. If such people are a small proportion, however, I think it can be valuable - they can contribute a voice from a population/interest not normally represented, and in turn they can also hear the discussion of other board members and see how it does or does not benefit the groups they represent. No clear-cut rules or recommendations though - which is why an approval process makes sense, which is another place I agree with Sanders.

Generally agree with the rest here - Sanders' writing is definitely alarmist, but it doesn't mean he doesn't have good points to make. After all, that's why the US isn't a monarchy - no individual can make perfect policy; they need advisors, agreement, and compromise.

Tackling [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3zlkax/sanders_on_tbtf/cyn24z6/) here.

Glass-Steagall, mixed banking, and the 2008 crisis: [This article](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/14/448685233/fact-check-did-glass-steagall-cause-the-2008-financial-crisis) seems to offer a second take on it. If Glass-Steagall did help to keep banks smaller, then it probably did play a factor - however, I would agree that the subprime mortgage-BS rating-CDO security profit machine would probably have continued, Glass-Steagall or no.

The rest of the comment addresses big banks in particular - here, I think the commenter is avoiding the elephant in the room. Sanders is criticizing _the need for the bailout_ - he's advocating that banks who engage in massive fraud like the subprime mortgage crisis should suffer the consequences, and fail, so as to deter such fraud in the future. Digging into the nature of efficiencies of scale, in this case, is kind of navel-gazing - interesting, but not really relevant unless you're refuting one of the following four points:

- Subprime mortgage lending involved defrauding customers for profit
- Fraud of this kind must have a negative incentive sufficient to deter
- Failure, in the sense of bankruptcy and liquidation, would be a sufficient deterrent
- Bailouts eliminate this deterrent, and thus enable future fraud

I'm not a deep-numbers economics guy, and with respect to fraudulent or criminal activity, I look at cost/benefit and incentives, which is a much simpler and less ambiguous realm. Sure, there might be a net efficiency cost to having small banks instead of a few big banks - but natural monopolies can also be more efficient than competitive markets in utilities-like industries. That doesn't mean monopolies are inevitable, it means some restructuring might be necessary to avoid or limit the problems of monolithism (price-gouging, in the natural-monopoly case, or the need for bailout, in the big-bank case).

Your second sentence doesn't support the first. Nuance, here, matters - I don't see people claiming that NAFTA or TPP as a whole were bad for the economy as a monolith; I hear people saying that it has been bad for auto workers and other manufacturers, that cheap labor has pulled those jobs away from US workers. Yes, there's automation to worry about too, and I don't completely agree with that sentiment - but to say that they're wrong because NAFTA was a net benefit to the economy is, I think, a strawman. They're trying to defend the rights of a specific, suffering group of Americans - and they have every right and prerogative to do so. You can _rebut_ them, but that doesn't make either of you wrong - it makes your priorities different. (Particular note: comparative advantage theory indicates free trade should increase total income to each country, monolithically. It says nothing about individual net benefit, which may be harshly negative - it's up to the country to determine proper distribution of benefit, which is why this is a political debate topic, not an economic one.)

Not at all arguing that point - there are plenty of social liberals in Wall Street, and in tech elite as well. What if the country needs economic progressivism, though? Is Wall Street willing to cut into their margins and abandon some business models, so that economic power can be rebalanced towards US workers say, through re-unionization? Do rich progressives donate towards efforts to raise taxes on them, or reform Wall Street to control share buybacks and force corporations to deliver value through capital investment and growth potential? When unionization causes wages, and thus costs of operation, to rise, how will Wall Street feel about it?

The technical definition of neoliberal here is _economic and social liberalism_ - free-market combined with concern about civil rights and discrimination. [EDIT: For the sharp-eyed, I used two different definitions of liberal there. Probably self-evident what I'm trying to say, but can clarify if necessary.] As a progressive, I can be very concerned about the first and in full agreement with the second.

Again, I don't agree with demonization - I will, however, unabashedly and righteously hammer his economic positions if he doesn't think defending the welfare of US workers is important, that the world is changing and they just ""have to get used to it"". Again, doesn't mean I disagree on the social dimension.

This is an article about _consistency of support/opposition_ to things like TPP/NAFTA. The only quote I see about Sanders' position is the following:

> I think they have been a disaster for the American worker. A lot of corporations that shut down here move abroad. Working people understand that after NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China we have lost millions of decent paying jobs. Since 2001, 60,000 factories in America have been shut down. We’re in a race to the bottom, where our wages are going down. Is all of that attributable to trade? No. Is a lot of it? Yes.

Maybe I don't grasp English, but I see this supporting my assessment of his position, not yours.

The [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/populist) indicates that it's about representing the common people, or a believer in the rights, wisdom, or virtues of the common people. To say that Trump demonstrates the irrationality of populism is to say that a feminist that says ""fuck men"" demolishes feminism as a movement. Will remind, too - Trump, for all his bluster, insubstantial (but populist) positions, and deeply flawed personality, _won the election_. Hypothesis: Maybe that's because populism _alone_ resonated so strongly that people didn't care about anything else. His insincerity about it doesn't mean that populism is wrong.

By comparison, a [demagogue](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demagogue) uses popular prejudices and false claims to obtain power. It's about using _popular positions_ in an _insincere way_ - basically, a con. Populism is about _championing the common man_ - they're not the same thing. Trump was, in a way, _both_ - his _demagoguery_ disqualifies him, not his populism.

Two issues with this:

1. This doesn't point out specific positions/arguments you think are bad - it's a blanket attack, to say ""you should realize what's wrong"" - a lazy, insubstantial, and defensive mode of argument. I challenge you to do better. Specific links, specific words, point out concretely what you find wrong.
2. Once more, the worst doesn't represent the movement. If you don't think the movement is justified, don't attack the worst of it - attack and defeat it at its _best_, and speak directly and firmly to the core arguments behind it.

Nobody has an explanation for why she was granted this highly unusual exception

The original visa was from Loretta Lynch / DoJ, which is how her name got dragged into this, but that wasn't active when she met with Trump Jr, instead it was the state department keeping her in the country, and nobody knows why, and the state department can't discuss individual cases"
1067,"Even then this argument doesn't make sense.

1069,"I lived in Russia for several years and have traveled pretty extensively and have dealt with many visas, also dealt with Russians getting US visas. Since that is more specifically relevant, I'll explain the ordinary process for a Russian getting a US visa. You fill out the application, set an appointment, go to the US embassy for an interview/meeting, and hey decide to issue or not issue a visa. It's more or less the same for work or vacation, with proper documentation required for either. (Many tourist applications are denied, for the record; I knew many people that applied year after year hoping for one but no luck. Others applied and were granted the first time. A lot of factors go in to it.) Anyway, it's also important to know, any documents can be faked in Russia. Anything. You can buy medical records proving you were sick. You can buy diplomas. You can buy anything. Now, I'm not saying you can get a fake US visa (though I have heard of somebody trying to bribe their interviewer... ha) but you can fake all supporting documents required in order to get your application approved. 

Maybe this is useful, maybe not,  but it's somewhat relevant and, I think, a bit interesting. "

If you were, say, a plastics engineer in Russia (trying to pick something not defense / government related), and your company wanted to send you to a plastics convention in the US, I don't think it would be that hard to get that visa. I've known academics from Russia in the US.

1080,Trump was not Obama's political rival.
1081,"Both the emails and the [court filings](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3519326/PREVEZON-APPEAL.pdf) show she had a reason to be here on June 9 2016. There's no question to begged. 

Additionally, it was definitely the Russians that sent her. She works for an oligarch who is friends with Trump's oligarch friends. Her husband is a high ranking government official. She has a longstanding personal relationship with Yuri Chaika, referenced in the emails, who in turn has been loyal to Putin for over a decade. She's no low-level lawyer; she is infamous in Russia, particularly Moscow."
1082,"Thanks for sharing this.  I am always fascinated by the fact that so many people are able to get fake documents.  I understand that I live and have always lived an extremely sheltered life but I wouldn't know how to go about faking any kind of official document to save my life.  Here's a stupid story for you but around Christmas time, I sent a package to Canada and had my mom send it out for me for some reason that day that I no longer remember and anyways she's half deaf.  Everything was all sealed up and she had little knowledge of what was in the box I was shipping out but it was several hundred dollars worth of Star Wars merchandise in it and when you send anything out internationally, you have to declare everything properly and it's value exactly and pay taxes and stuff.  She didn't hear what I said over the phone and told the post office that it was some SW Christmas gifts worth less than $100.  When she gave me the post office receipt a few days later, I was absolutely convinced I was going to fucking jail.  You can't screw up government paperwork, am I right? So, next The Post Office had lost the package but told me Canada lost it.  Canada told me they never received it.  This went on for weeks and on top of it all...there was a Star Wars trading card in the box that I bought off eBay ""signed"" by Mark Hamill but I was convinced it was fake.   I told the person I was sending it to that it was probably fake but they were going to use it to prank their boyfriend who was a super big Star Wars fan.  Sounds funny, right?  Not so funny when you might have to explain to the Canadian Postal Inspectors that the package you didn't properly declare by hundreds of dollars also probably contains at least one piece of counterfeit merchandise.  Yeah I was freaking out for what felt like years.  The package arrived, like 6 weeks after Christmas and the Canadians didn't want me to pay any extra taxes and I am living my life today as a free woman. And Mark Hamill later confirmed that my trading card was his real signature on Twitter.  I swear to god this is a true story.  It's late here.  I don't know why I just wrote all this out now."

1086,"The person above is correct, you're ignoring what they said.  She was granted the special parole to be in the country only until Jan. 2016.  The meeting didn't happen until Jun. of 2016.  She was in the country at that point apparently because she had been granted a visa after the immigration parole had expired."
1087,"You're messing up the timeline. That's october of 2015. Just click on the fox news link, I shouldn't have to reiterate whats in the OP article. Read this paragraph:

>According to the timeline released by the Department of Homeland Security, the Obama Justice and Homeland Security departments granted her a special type of “parole” to be in the U.S. from September 2015 through February 2016 to work on a court case in New York. After that expired, according to DHS, the State Department issued her a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa in June 2016, according to DHS, just in time for her meeting with Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Like I said, the parole offered by the DoJ for the court case expired before she met with Trump Jr. Her DoJ visa had expired in January/February 2016, she applied for an extension and it was denied, and its unclear whether she was in the country illegally between then and June, but in June, just prior to meeting with Trump Jr, she was given a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa by the state department and nobody has an explanation for *why*

The OP's article is literally stating it has a ""timeline"", and you could have just checked that."

1089,"Because before meeting with them, it would be too early to report anything to the FBI because Trump Jr had no way to know if the intel was credible, and didn't even know the names of who he was meeting with. What would he report? What he was offered is not even illegal under US law and he had no idea whether it was legitimate. Once he'd met with them, he realized it was just a hoax to lure him to the meeting so they could talk about the magnitsky act, so there was nothing to report

Meanwhile Hillary Clinton's campaign met with the Ukrainian embassy to get opposition research on Paul Manafort. When approached by the embassy, they didn't report it to the FBI, and instead set up a liason to organize the transfer of documents. Then unlike the Trump Jr case, they actually *did* get real intel from the Ukrainians. And the never reported that to the FBI, and we only found out because Podesta clicked on a phishing link. And like Trump Jr, what they did is not illegal under US law.

>Trump is in bed with the Russians. Sorry you got duped.

If Trump was in bed with the Russians, why did two anti-magnitsky act lobbyists have to take the unusual step of using a false pretense to bait Trump's campaign into meeting with them in the first place? If they were actually colluding, there would be no need for such misdirection, and they'd have more secure means of communicating. If there's some conspiracy, they wouldn't need to lure Trump Jr in with false promises"

1195,"Yes according to [Axios] (https://www.axios.com/russian-that-met-with-don-jr-came-to-u-s-via-obamas-doj-2458560689.html) she wasn't even supposed to be in the country.

>Veselnitskaya was granted limited ""special immigration parole"" by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch to defend Russian businessman Denis Katsyv in a federal forfeiture case. The Hill confirmed she was in the country from October 2015 to early January 2016, but officials ""could not immediately explain"" how she was still in the U.S. for her meeting with Trump Jr. 

Email chain from June 2016 (6 months after losing track of Veselnitskaya's whereabouts)

GOLDSTONE: Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.

TRUMP JR: How about 3 at our offices?

GOLDSTONE: Would it be possible to move tomorrow meeting to 4pm as the Russian attorney is in court until 3 i was just informed.

TRUMP JR: Yes Rob I could do that unless they wanted to do 3 today instead.

GOLDSTONE: They can’t do today as she hasn’t landed yet from Moscow 4pm is great tomorrow.

What court was she in? Are there records that she flew in from Moscow that day to go to court? Was she already in America? I'm confused."
1196,You mean it's not Obamas fault that Trump Jr met with russians!?
1197,But I've never met with Russians! - Trump campaign
1198,"It's good to know that Obama personally oversaw every single work visa violation, because that's totally something presidents do. Also, wasn't the lady being brought up on charges and required to appear during that timeframe? Not sure I understand where the ~~rightists~~ Bund are coming from on this one. "
1199,">But she's evil because Obama let her in.

The timeline doesn't add up. Her ""Obama issued Visa"" expired months prior to this meeting. She didn't have one at the time of the meeting.

Either she overstayed her visa and lied about flying in from Moscow, or she somehow entered the US without a visa.

Either way, her presence in the country at the time wasn't due to Obama's decision."
1200,"Actually, she was there until 3pm, and it was for a [deposition](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3519326/PREVEZON-APPEAL.pdf)."
1201,"That’s interesting.

Either she was already in the USA, was overstaying her visa, and lied about flying from Moscow OR she somehow entered without a visa."
1202,She was at the [Pavlov deposition](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3519326/PREVEZON-APPEAL.pdf). See page 7 for the scheduled date.
1203,Obama wore that tan suit once and used Dijon mustard. He was clearly directing the Trump campaign to collude with the Russians by doing those things!

1205,Pretty crafty. Wouldn't surprise me to learn she is an agent of the Russian FIS.

1209,"This article is spouting total nonsense, but [Reason.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_\(magazine\)) is from the [Reason Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_Foundation), a Koch-affiliated group. And who are the Kochs?

>On its own in 2012, the Kochs' network of a few hundred individuals spent at least $407 million, almost all of it anonymously. This was more than John McCain spent on his entire 2008 presidential bid. And it was more than the combined contributions to the two presidential campaigns made by 5,667,658 Americans, whose donations were legally capped at $5,000. *Politico's* Kenneth Vogel crunched the numbers and discovered that in the presidential race the top .04 percent of donors contributed about the same amount as the bottom 68%.

We really need to work on cutting down the [proliferation of dark money funding our elections](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/A_Maze_of_Money.png/1307px-A_Maze_of_Money.png); class warfare is the Republican strategy. We already have explosive social stratification and limited social mobility, but rather than treating that, we're racing head-on toward the policies that will exacerbate the problem. Dirt like Robert Mercer, the Koch brothers, and their networks pump millions of dollars into election cycles in order to buy favorable coverage. They're worked endlessly to weaken out protections in favor of their own nutty anarcho-capitalist ideas.

This hurts candidates: for them, [shadowy groups](https://dividednolonger.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/kochtopus.png) funding attacks ads is a bit like being in a boxing ring with your opponent while people from the audience pelt you with items to throw you off your game. For voters, it's a bit like wandering through a forest and running into a bunch of different people [wearing masks](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0c/ae/45/0cae45413635f05a5ad442d32f54e979.jpg), all trying to talk you into do the same thing until you find out that underneath the masks, it's all the same guy, changing his appearance cause he has the funds and means to fool you. And how do these people feel about workers? Let's take a look at [Robert Mercer](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years) of Cambridge Analytica, who is one of the Kochs major donors and was one of the instrumental people who funded Trump's campaign, as well as bringing Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon onto his team:

>[David Magerman, a partner at Renaissance Technologies] said that Mercer wanted to shrink the government to the size of a pinhead and that he doesn't think that - he basically has a philosophy, according to Magerman, that values people on the basis of what they earn. [He doesn't think human beings have intrinsic value.](https://mindinflux.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nazi6.jpg) He thinks that if you are a schoolteacher and you earn 2 million times less than Mercer earns, then you're 2 million times less valuable than Mercer is. And he believes that if you are on welfare, you have negative value. And what Magerman said was, and he's not talking about economically. He means as a human being.

For them, it's not a matter of finding out what the American people want; it's how much money they need to use to run focus groups to trick the Americans into voting for what the wealthy want. Look at the ""inheritance tax"" being called the [""death tax.""](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax). Or any of the other shady work by [Frank Luntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz).

Gotta [follow the money](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/31/koch-brothers-donor-network-to-focus-on-senate-not-presidential-race.html).

For the last 40 years, they've been using their [family foundations to funnel money] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family_foundations) into building an ideological pipeline to normalize conservative ideas and shift the goalposts of the discussion, groups like the [Cato Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute), [the Reason Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_Foundation), [Mercatus Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercatus_Center), the [Heritage Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation), all of these libertarian thinktanks and others that are shadily funded and happen to crank out position papers against worker protections, regulations, minimum wage, etc., claiming it is in the interest of workers even though it these same things have consistently screwed them over. Take a look at how they duck regulations to treat their employees, seemingly completely at odds with their libertarian philosophy of employers looking out for their workers:  [Bull Carlson](http://realkochfacts.com/snowzilla-reading-the-devastating-story-of-how-the-kochs-business-practices-hurt-real-people/) (fired with minimal severance after his work with Koch left him with cancer), [Sally Barnes-Soliz](http://kochcash.org/victims-voices-sally-barnes-soliz/) (fired for pointing out that the Kochs reported less than 1% of their actual benzene emissions), [Carnell Green](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-whistle-blower-accuses-the-kochs-of-poisoning-an-arkansas-town) (fired and intimidated by a Koch security officer pretending to be FBI for reporting improper disposal of the toxic substance mercury), and [Danielle Smalley and Jason Stone](http://kochcash.org/victims-voices-danielle-smalley-jason-stone/) (non-Koch employees; shortly after graduation, car stops on a road; when the key is turned in the ignition, it leads to an explosion. Why? Because the Kochs were using an underground pipeline that ""looked like Swiss cheese"" to transport an explosive gas) are all eye-opening reads.

By viewing the centralist establishment as socialism, the Kochs and other libertarians redefined their extreme-right-wing, borderline anarchist views into a marketable product by spending hundreds of millions of dollars raised from them and other wealthy people to test different groups in order to weaponize information (Look at Luntz's work to discredit environmental science, though he later acknowledged global warming as serious).

When they, and other billionaires, were young, there was a loophole to avoid the inheritance tax: if the money was put into a trust and given to charitable groups for X (usually 20) years, then the money could be inherited tax-free. They weaponized this: instead of giving to legitimate, establishment charities (remember, they're peddling socialism, per the Kochs!), they found out how to create and fund partisan organizations and put their money into politics while still taking advantage of the tax loophole. This often took advantage of political giving not being the ""primary"" objective of the organization.

You and I are capped at $5,000 dollar donations for candidates, non-deductible; these guys, on the other hand, through their shady funding methods, can write these expenses off as charitable donations. After *Citizens United*, they even were able to write off part of their 2012 campaign against Obama as a business expense, therefore deductible on their year-end taxes. Which is ironic, cause while Romney's out there bitching about people who don't pay taxes, [Diane Hendricks, estimated at a $3.2 billion fortune, didn't pay a penny in state income for years](http://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/wisconsins-richest-woman-paid-no-income-taxes-for-years).

1210,Is it time to dismiss libertarians? Yes.

1212,If we could just dismiss idiots we wouldn't be in the mess that we are currently in.
1213,"Yes, it's time. People who deny that free trade is generally a good thing for the economy in general, and that protectionism can be a good solution to problems low-wage workers are facing should be considered Economics deniers.

However, making choices that impact the economy negatively (for example, the French decision to have a 35 hour work week, rather than a 40 hour work week) but have positive effects on general satisfaction are not denying the merits of economics. It's just a different choice they make. As such, you can also choose to implement legislation that promotes income/wage equality, and such legislation always to some extend damages the economy.

Same with Climate change, if you accept the scientific truth that things need to be done about it, you don't necessarily all come to the same conclusion on what exactly needs to be done."

I don't know one conservative that denies that the climate does in fact change. The policy prescriptions are the battle

The first is: ‘Compared to what?’

The second is: ‘At what cost?’

And the third is: ‘What hard evidence do you have?’ 

Well the hard evidence we have is the climate does change. At what percentage is the climate change a direct result of man and what is a direct result of mother nature? Can the economic left answer the other 2 questions?"

The earths climate changes. It has constantly changed millions of times over billions of years. There are ancient civilizations under 10s to 100s of feet of water. Did they make such an impact on the earth that they lost the battle to climate change? Humans have been around how long? 100K years? Climate has changed drastically in that time, correct? I don't think this is controversial topic of human history. Humans have adapted to the climate change. 

If you are wearing your winter jacket inside, and start to get hot, are you going to turn the air conditioner on or take off your jacket?

The left should speak to the negatives AND the positives of increasing wages.  It shows intellectual honesty.  Of course some companies won't make the cut.  And we should acknowledge ""why"" they didn't make the cat AND why we shouldn't mourn businesses that don't prioritize fairly compensating their employees.

Can you battle climate change without putting us back into the 3rd world?

1227,"That is not wrong at all. We know there is an impact. Can you show proof that is 1%? 50%? 97% man made effect? No. You cannot.

We are ready the same set of data, you are interpreting it in a totalitarian, illogical matter. You cannot back your argument for policy positions because you do not know the risk, or the possible uncalculated risks.

The second is: ‘Compared to what?’

What are we comparing this data to? The time frames used for arguments are usually from mid 1800s to current. That is not a good comparison even if we want to use the small time frame man has been on this planet. The earths Climate has changed significantly. What happened to the civilizations 10s to 100s of feet under water? Did they lose the battle to man made climate change? Do ice samples might show this?

And the third is: ‘At what cost?’

Cars are not going anywhere, any time soon. I highly doubt you, your friends, your family, your employer leading by example. A whole lot of virtue signaling about climate change. 

Our economy is heavily oil dependent, and I don't see a great solution to combating climate change unless you want to plunge us back into a third world country. I don't see a great solution to supplement our dependency on oil, although we are making good strides in renewable technology, it is going to take time for that market to grow. In the meantime, we are dependent on oil. India and China are growing 2nd world countries, and if they want to be a 1st world country, they'll need energy. Energy that releases pollutants into the air, water, and land. "

Even non public figures have to prove malice to get the big money. They can still sue without that but even if they win the damages are typically a smaller amount than what successful suits where malice is proven will pay.

If the court agrees they did it, she wins. If they do not agree she loses. It all comes down to a matter of what she brings as evidence and what their defense against it is.

A wealthy republican donor who opposed Trump's candidacy hired Fusion GPS to create the dossier.

After Trump secured the nomination the FusionGPS contract was taken over by an unidentified democratic client.

It wasn't until June 2016 after the DNC was hacked that FusionGPS hired Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, to look into any Russian connections. The investigation was undertaken by Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele.

He continued his investigation even after the Democratic client stopped paying for it following Trump's election.

On his own initiative, Steele decided to also pass the information to British and American intelligence services because he believed the findings were a matter of national security for both countries.

>The judge in the case did ask the DOJ to extend Veselnitskaya’s stay in the country during the course of the case. She remained in the country months later, however, and ended up meeting many Congresspeople at an event at the Newseum in June 2016 at which she lobbied for the end of the Magnitsky Act.

>Many Trump supporters are leaping on this news to suggest some sort of nefarious scheme by the Obama administration to let Veselnitskaya into the country to promote a sting operation against the Trump campaign. This seems unlikely, given that her permission to stay was granted in January 2016, and her approach to Trump Jr. happened in June. Beyond that, a judge asked for the stay of deportation. And extraordinary circumstances are invoked by the Justice Department for a variety of reasons.

>Even if Veselnitskaya was allowed into the country as part of a grand conspiracy, it took action by Trump Jr. to make this happen. Plus, none of this would explain why the Obama administration wouldn’t let the cat out of the bag if they were in league with the Russians to take down Trump."

Many of his positions are the positions of a 19 year old kid who sees the easy moral high ground of every issue and races for it without consideration of the practicalities and compromise necessary in the real world.  That's why he was so popular with college kids.

I think America needs a strong foreign policy as well and imo Bernie would be way, way too soft.  For example, I think he'd have never entered into the THAAD agreement with South Korea.  Just like RoK's new government, he'd have a conciliatory stance toward DPRK, which is woefully naive and historically uninformed.

I could go on and on but it comes down to the fact that I don't think his domestic agenda would go very far considering he'd get no bipartisan support for it, and his foreign policy agenda would make the US weaker abroad."

That's just an unfortunate fact.

Bernie sat in his safe senate seat for years as an independent, holding every bill hostage that came his way so he could pull it farther to the left (sometimes that's good, sometimes that's not).

He didn't contribute to the Democratic party at all for decades.  Then he tacks a D on his chest and joins the party for the sole purpose of running in Democrat primaries.

And then he has the gall to whine about not getting access to the DNC's resources to the same degree that Hillary did and the DNC not giving him primetime debate broadcasts even though Bernie was never a serious challenge to Hillary's chances.

I just find that to be bullshit.  The DNC is a private organization.  They can pick candidates however they want. If Bernie hated the DNC's system and rules and ""unfair"" internal politics so much, he should've stayed an Independent."

Play any online game for an hour, you'll get some idiot, whether it's a troll or a true believer, saying the most vile shit imaginable. People let their kids watch twitch channels all day with no clue what's going on there.

1475,">“The Republican party, in general, really has an opportunity here to bring young folks into the fold, which they’ve had a very difficult time over the last couple of decades to do. They can do it early. Usually, Republicans attract folks as they get older but if Republicans play their cards right, Gen Z is primed to go into and embrace the Republican party.”

And there it is. First off, this ""gets more Republican as they age"" is a stupid myth that will not die. Republicans do well with the current generations that are 'old' because they've always done well with Boomers and Silent generation voters. People form strong party allegiances when they are young and usually lean that way throughout their life. It's why old people used to be more Democratic, and why the GOP's base used to be younger on average.

Second, if you go by his start date for generation z, which is around 1996, then in 2016 we already had about 1/3rd of the 18 - 24 age group being generation Z. The thing is, 18-24 year olds gave Clinton her highest vote share among all the exit poll's age groups. Trump did *worse than Romney with these voters.*

Third, most of generation z is under 18, and this is a time where people are most open to suggestion. Even if they are more predisposed to support Republicans *now,* it doesn't mean they will be once they graduate high school and go through college. Not to mention the surveys that have given people like this their ""genz = conservative"" talking points have been sketchy or unreliable, including that one so many quoted that was actually a survey of kids from the UK."

There is nothing sinister in my methods of conversation. I talk to people about things I think could be better, I accept new information, and I have my mind changed often.

Contrast that with what you are talking about. ""Red-pilling"", aka targeting impressionable, vulnerable loners (does this describe you I wonder?) to guide them down a ""rabbit hole"" to the truth. In case you can't see it, I'll spell it out: this is how cults operate. What you call ""far liberalism"" is conservatism in every other western country, but you are so far down your rabbit hole you think your cult's terms and vocabulary are the only ""real"" way to engage with the world.

I hope someone who cares about you can get you the help you need. People don't get into ""red-pilling"" because they are on an emotionally and mentally healthy place.

1505,"Are you part of the games community? I am. And nobody takes a dumb Nazi joke seriously. And none of these big streams are alt right. I can tell you from personal experience that in my years of gaming, and talking politics with a decent number of people, I haven't met a single alt right supporter. I've met people who make offensive jokes, but not the alt right. Anyone who tries to say that gaming is a major harbor for the alt right is pretty divorced from reality."

1507,"Wrong, there is a reason why more people become conservative as they grow older. When young adults start working they become wiser. They realize half their paycheck is missing, they realize the government is wasting their hard earn money, they realize that crooked politicians want to increase taxes, they realize that communism and socialism is a pipe dream, they realize the rich are creating new product or investing in new product, not the middle class or the lower class, they no longer see rich as evil like the liberals portray them to be and get motivated to become one.

This exactly what happened to me and millions of other young adults."

If you haven't seen fascists in gaming, I don't know what to tell you. They exist, they're everywhere. Good grief, click on any alt-right comment on Reddit, you will find posts in one or several gaming subreddits riddled with the same alt-right nonsense from the same people. I'm well aware what fascism is, and I'm well aware that it's popular to claim the word is overused. I'm not misusing it.

""Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism,[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce"""

The ignorance and naivete is palpable.  They literally don't care about rolling back the improvements made under the Obama administration out of spite.  And they think this somehow will shake the system up for the better.

All it will do is inflict unnecessary harm onto our country and literally kill their fellow countrymen (Don T. Care).  That is not a liberal.  That is not a progressive.  That is a reactionary. A petulant child. 

Progress comes in increments (sometimes in spurts like the 111th Congress) and rolling back that progress can take years or generations to fix.  

Take HC.  Obamacare, while imperfect, was a step in the right direction. Instead of fighting to improve it, we are not fighting to make it even more radically regressive.  And who knows when they next time we will have another opportunity to actually improve our HC system.

I understand Hillary had an image problem. She is a career politician with some actual dirt.  She has also been under RW assault of manufactured scandals for decades. She certainly lacks in the charisma department.

American politics is cyclical and I hope it's about to shift back towards the left after a decade of Republican control of congress and state houses, and of the overall narrative.

I mean... you can *say* that, but it's an absurd statement. Hillary actually won the popular vote. AND the primaries. It could be argued that if Bernie supporters had eventually supported her, we wouldn't be having a trump problem right now. Hillary supporters and Bernie supporters both use the ""If you had all just voted for MY candidate, we wouldn't be in this mess"" line.

And you know who wins? Republicans. Because they've managed to divide their opposition. They love it when progressives play with purity tests, and start look sideways at people who only agree with them about 95% of the issues instead of all 100% percent of all the issues.

>this makes moderate Dems complicit with trumpism

yes, the moderate dems standing up for medicaid and healthcare are DEFINITELY complicit with trump who's trying to take it away. Flawless logic.
"
1636,I view Trump and Bernie as both being populists.  Populism has always ended badly.
1637,[deleted]
1638,Hillary ran the most progressive platform in several decades. If that didn't interest you I really don't think anything will.
1639,"I just don't even know where to start with that.  Bernie wasn't a wasted opportunity.  He's a step in the right direction.  The fact that 2 of the final 3 major candidates were populists (even though one was a lying sack of shit) speaks volumes about where we are as a country.

But Bernie losing was a necessary evil, IMO.  It highlighted a SHITTON of problems that need to be addressed.  

1)  The super delegate system is fucked, and needs revising.  Hillary still had more overall delegates, even without the super delegates (2200 to 1850, give or take), so even splitting the super delegates 50/50 would have given her the win.  Still, the perception that she was ""always going to win"" probably influenced Bernie's chances negatively.

2)  The GOP is not as dead as we thought.  They still came out in force with 60+ million votes, and voted for a complete and total piece of shit.  They proved without question that you could light a piece of shit infested with herpes on fire with an (R) next to it, and they would still vote for it.  Forget christian values (Trump has none), forget common sense (Trump has none), forget coherent plans (Trump has none)...they will literally vote for anything with an (R), no matter what comes out of its mouth.  Trump may be right...he could probably kill someone on 5th avenue and still be elected, and that's terrifying.

3)  Negative campaigning works for republicans, and we need to combat it.  One of the reasons Hillary got more attention with super delegates was that apparently the GOP had a nice, heaping folder of dirt on Bernie as well.  I don't have that source off hand, but I do recall reading about it more than once.  More still, Bernie would not have been able to do shit in congress, which is something Bernie supporters don't seem to get (and I voted for Bernie in the primaries, if you're wondering).  If the GOP still had the senate and house (they might have lost one or both if Bernie was on the ballot, true), or even as the minority party, the GOP would continue to obstruct.  Bernie wanted to expand the ACA and go single payer.  You think Mitch Mcdickturtle would have allowed that?  You think he would have allowed more increases in taxes on the wealthy, or UBI for the poor?  Your final comment is the absolute epitome of this as a problem ""this makes moderate Dems complicit with Trumpism.""  Either you're trolling, and my giant fucking message will be laughed at by you, or you're fucking gullible as shit.  If you didn't vote for Hillary, then you sir, are the one who is complicit with Trumpism.   Maybe you did vote for her, but if not, then regardless of who the democrats selected (and like I said...Hillary won the primary, even without the super delegates), you bought into the whole ""democrats have betrayed you"" message which the republicans (and err...Russian social media trolls/bots) have spewed from day one of Hillary's nomination.  You KNEW that Trump was an absolute piece of shit, and should have done your social duty to prevent it.  I hope you did.

4)  The country needs to heal and wake up.  We have Trump because of 2+ decades of shit-smearing by republicans.  He is a symptom of a disease.  A stupidly large number of people in this country still believe shit like Obama is a muslim, college is bad, and that trickle down economics will save us all.  These people are programmed.  They are fucked.  They actually believe democrats are evil, to varying degrees (the irony of course is that I think this of republicans...at least the politicians...I think the voters are just misled hypocrites).  The country also needs to wake the fuck up.  While Trump might be fun to laugh at, and his commentary during the campaign might have been fun for some, others of us think he's a fucking nightmare.  We gave the nuclear football to a petty, money grabbing, womanizing, sack of shit who spews hate-speech against pretty much everyone from LBGT, muslims, mexicans/latinos, etc.  His first invites/calls in the white house included pieces of shit like Edrogan and Deuterte, and pissing off China by contacting Taiwan.  People need to know this, and understand why its not okay...but they are either too blind, don't care, don't want to care, or too far off the deep end to understand it.  They need help.  It's up to us to provide that help, if we can.

Republicans are intimidated by Clinton, they considered her a threat, I mean isn't it fucking obvious?

1654,the party has never pushed such a flawed candidate before. Weve seen candidates drop out for much less problems than what Hillary had. Half of it was because they thought regardless of her flaws she could beat Trump.
1655,"Yes, party overconfidence and willful blindness to an inherently flawed candidate had nothing to do with it. Nor was it the shoring up hundreds of superdelegates before a single state primary was held. Couldn't have been the ""lost"" voter registrations or arbitrary laws preventing a change in party six months ahead of voting in Bernie's birthstate. And the name Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a person no one is familiar with.

(This progressive ideal, did it start after 2013 when she still publicly opposed same sex marriage?)"
1656,"Sure, but there's also something to be said about getting someone other than the person that the opposing side has been building a case against and dragging through the mud for the past several decades.  Add in the lack of charisma and the fact that she had already lost a presidential bit already, she was pretty damn unelectable

The only thing that keeps this election close is the fact that Trump had the lowest approval rating of any candidate since the metric started.  If the Republicans had nominated halfway sane, they probably could have wiped the floor with Clinton.

You can blame Sanders and his supporters all you want, Clinton was a failure as a candidate.  She had good policies, but when it came to inspiring people to vote for her rather than expect those good little numbers to fall in line, she failed.  She lacked the charisma to pull it off and had the deck stacked against her thanks to being smeared by Republicans since 1994.

But supposedly she was the electable candidate."
1657,Yes because Americans are stupid
1658,"This. It seems entirely too obvious when you look at their comment history, that their primary goal here is to weaken the anti-Trump movement by fomenting a split.

Alt-Righters on 4chan talk about doing this shit all the time, they recruit each other for troll ""operations"" to try and influence discourse and opinion on other platforms (reddit is often a primary target).  During the election a popular angle that they openly discussed on /pol/ was pretending to be Bernie supporters who refuse to vote for Clinton.

**EDIT**: Yes, it's a confirmed alt-right troll.  They just [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6n9dcg/lena_dunham_sells_dress_she_cried_in_on_election/) a Breitbart article about Lena Dunham to /r/politics. LOL."
1659,"The wonders so far are not because the Democratic party compromised on anything, its becauae the idea of the Democratic party itself is no longer viable and they cannot capture Progressives which means both Dems and Progressives, usually one and the same, will keep losing. Even if Progressives form their own party they will keep losing."
1660,"It sucks that Bernie lost...but realistically, it had to happen for significant changes to take place.

So I guess using the complete non-logic we've seen so far, it's fair to say Bernie rigged that.

Bernie's home state allowed new voter registration 1 month before the primary. We should have party switch deadlines a certain amount of time out. Arbitrary would imply they were random, but they've been this way for quite some time now. Kind of important to know deadlines if you want to vote.

Speaking of Bernie's birth state, he lost the neighborhood he was born in 2:1

Nobody is immune to the kind of smear campaign that Republicans can wage, changing candidates doesn't solve the problem. They've already started working on other potentially threatening Democrats. Republicans would have loved to face Bernie Sanders, why would we give into them?

I'm plenty progressive and I can think of hundreds of reasons to vote for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. If people can find inspiration then that's their problem. There is a word for people who refuse to take political action because they're feeling uninspired: it's called conservativism. "

she was flawed because she couldnt answer questions, I honestly understand why she wouldn't but its still an issue. She came off as trying to hide while campaigning and people questioned that. shes a flawed candidate because she couldn't answer questions not because she chose not to.

>The fact is Clinton would have been harder on the industry than trump who is removing regulations that Clinton campaigned to increase. So I'm not sure what evidence you have that she would not be hard on them. In fact, if you've ever bothered to read her speeches or watch the YouTube videos to those particular industries you'll see she tells them just that. 

Clinton would have been 10 times better than Trump but that doesn't make her less flawed.

This is why we need to let things happen naturally. A woman WILL be president some day and hopefully it will be someone who is honest and has some integrity. Hillary was just as grimy and corrupt as any man that came before her. So much so that she lost to Trump, and quote the popular vote all you want but it means fuck all because who is the president right now? If the left had focused on policy and got behind Bernie, because 2016 was his year, we would be having probably one of the best years in American history right now. But instead, the left made a poor choice and we all suffering for it while they STILL just make excuses, yell about Trump, and offer no fucking solutions to anything of their own. 

The left needs to snap out of this self absorbed delusion of being ""right"" about everything and they need to do it fast because even tho I'm not the biggest fan of the left this country cannot survive 8 years of Trump.

Regarding the woman aspect - I agree, _for those who voted for a woman because she is a woman_ - that's meaningless and counter to the idea and image of gender balance. Until I have strong evidence of that being a major factor though, I wouldn't assume that happened either. I do find it likely that many supported her because of the Democratic party platform, and because of concern over social issues, non-discrimination, etc. In this, Trump ran a _far-far-right_ platform on social, and he deserved to lose many voters over that.

At the same time - while the Democratic platform was decently progressive, the party as a whole can do much more to be explicitly pro-labor, and candidates can do more to demonstrate that they care about the platform. In this case, [Clinton's ads](http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/blog/2016-election-study-published/) failed to deliver - instead of focusing on her own platform, she worked on demonizing Trump. Ultimately, it played right into beliefs that she was two-faced on her own election platform, and failed to sway those who didn't already trust her - an unmitigated disaster of an advertising campaign.

I don't think litigating whether or not Clinton _was_ two-faced is that useful at this point - more relevant are avoiding her concrete mistakes on the campaign trail, and focusing on giving voice to the voiceless in society - yes, that includes _both_ minorities and middle/flyover America."

The left did not vote for Hillary cause she was a women. She was voted for because she had actually policies and ideas.

Or every time she was lobbied to do what Wall Street, the banks, and big corporate wanted her to do that seemingly always leaves the public behind? And don't even get me started with the bullshit that goes on within the Clinton Foundation lol But hey she is on the left so you gotta protect one of your own right? Excuses, excuses, always more excuses. That is all you guys ever have. Maybe just try facing reality? Its not that bad to admit that you fucked up and chose the wrong person to back. I mean really you wouldn't be the only one in life that backed an asshole without realizing it lol"
1797,This... This can't be a serious reply that you believe in?
1798,You mean reality over biased bullshit? Yeah. I tend to stick with reality lol You can't prove shit and you know it. This is just getting sad and obsession over the Russia lie is going to cost you guys on the left election after election until you finally figure it out. What really steams you is that what I just said is entirely true because its already going down that way. 4 special election losses man. Figure it out already lol
1799,">  the bullshit that goes on within the Clinton Foundation lol

I mean that for starters. Probably one of the most scrutinized charities there is out there and still gets top marks for transparency and use of funds. But people without any understanding decide stuff like the uranium ore deal is some sort of indication of corruption or whatever when it takes less than 0.5 seconds of context to realize that's a ridiculous position."
1800,"I mean even if they did the Democrats were siding with the country that was invaded they didn't side with the country doing the invading.

But investigate away. I don't give a fuck. Lock anyone up who has committed a crime. I'm cool with that. The entire world could be guilty. Doesn't mean Trump is innocent."
1801,"I'd be real concerned about this if Hillary were our President right now. Even so, it's concerning. Let's investigate, and if Hillary and/or the DNC folks did something illegal let's put them in the cell next to Trump and the RNC cronies."
1802,"So lock them all up, Trump and Clinton. The law is the law and nobody is above it."
1803,"This is what republicans don't understand. Just because they will deny their candidates ever did anything wrong, other folks won't. 

If they want to investigate stuff, they can go ahead. We won't cause a stink about how it needs to be stopped immediately, and if actual laws were broke, we won't defend those people. At the same time, they use this as a deflection like ""We aren't investigating X so you need to stop investigating Y!""

That's not how this works. 

How long did the Benghazi hearings go again?"
1804,[deleted]

I'm agreeing with the guy above that if they want to investigate they can go ahead because we don't hold loyalties like the Republicans.

Kathy Lee made joking death threats to Trump, was immediately criticized and blacklisted by D's.

"
1809,"Except the President, his spokespeople, Fox News and his other enablers.

Let's follow the facts where they lead.  If Democrats acted inappropriately, so be it - they should face appropriate legal consequences.

1821,"Remember when the Democrats traveled back in time to place Obama's birth announcement in a Hawaiian newspaper in 1961, to make him look like an American citizen?

Democrats, man."
1822,"it all makes perfect sense.

1. entrap Donald Trump Jr. into taking a meeting with a Russian spy using a guy he's known for a decade
2. forget to campaign in Wisconsin
3. lose the election
4. wait until after the Electoral College votes
5. wait until after the inauguration
6. wait another *six months* after that

1825,"Then why have the people in attendance at this meeting lied at every single opportunity and thrown up smoke screen after smoke screen to try and play this off as a ""nothing burger"".

If this were even remotely true then the administration would be shouting from the roof tops about this, making as big a deal out of it as they could, not trying to hide the details of the meeting at all costs."

It doesn't even matter if it was (it wasn't).  Jr. jumped at the OPPORTUNITY to work with the russian gov to effect the election.  Full stop.  "
1830,"Here's the setup:

Russians knew by even getting them in that room that it could be destabilizing. If there was somehow no legacy of compromise beforehand, they had it by that meeting. They positioned themselves to disrupt the country no matter the political victor, and won, still winning. For the Trumps, winning at any cost will turn out to have a hefty bill.

They could unknowingly be doing us a favor like a controlled burn but this is more likely gonna be a wild fire that we just watch in all consuming awe."

1836,"This is likely that kind of propaganda where the truth is mashed up with a bunch of bullshit and presented back as the truth in order to make it easy to discredit.

The actuality is more likely the FSB doing a social engineering job for leverage. This would literally be no surprise, in fact it is even likely. Honeytraps are a thing, and The Donald can't keep his mouth shut or his hands to himself, so he is/was ripe for this sort of exploitation.

1844,"Not only that, but they changed his name on the birth certificate from Barry Soetoro to Barack Obama. I don't know why they decided to keep ""Hussein,"" but I'm sure they have their reasons."
1845,"It's a fair question to ask for the 3 seconds it takes to remember that (a) Putin hates Hillary like nobody's business; (b) there is zero evidence Russia tried to help the Dems; (c) Trump made his Russia appeasement stance known from the start while Hillary was extremely hawkish; (d) mounds of evidence of Trump collusion are about to dribble out.

Here is a video of the head of the DHS admitting that they never saw the server, and they weren't allowed to do a warrent on a ""political association"" whatever that means https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx6Z_BAGPqw&list=PLBeDLbL2Rdxklnv4Z3lxOFSlvco0eoslC&index=11

Here is a more recent article about the server http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/

Here is the previous Prime Minister agreeing with Assange and saying that the Guccifer hack was an inside job from a ""disgruntled DNC insider who was 'motivated by ‘disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.'"" released the leaks, and NOT Russia. http://www.snopes.com/former-british-ambassador-says-he-not-russia-is-the-dnc-leaker/

The only people that have investigated the server was a third party company hired by the DNC called ""Crowdstrike"" and tehy have had to retract ""collusion"" claims http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-28/something-stinks-here-crowdstrike-revises-retracts-parts-explosive-russian-hacking-r

in fact, the latest develepmont from the Guccifer metadata suggests that the info was not hacked at all but copied locally from a USB drive, confirming Assange and the Prime MInister of Englands claims. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-10/new-research-shows-guccifer-20-files-were-copied-locally-dnc-not-hacked-russians

I'm a Sanders supporter btw donated 400$ to him and I hate Donald Trump"
2011,Jeez this is only the FOURTH time. Cut him a break /s
2012,"until I stop messing up the title, so this should be the last time"
2013,"I'm not saying that Jr trying to drudge up dirt on Hillary from Russians is not despicable, 

I'm just saying that comparing that actively conspiring against an entire country through massive media manipulation is a MUCH more trumped up charge. 

Podesta could do serious time for this. 

Where as Trump can't even get impeached from his son attempting to get dirt. 

It's despicable but probably not really illegal, as is most plutocratic things in our country. (like bailing out the banks, monopolizing on drug prices, profiting off of student debt, private prisons, ect)

 I mean the Trump Vrs. Hillary campaign and vice versa was a pure smear campaign. In fact a study showed that Hillary, not Trump had the most smear based, policy missing campaign in American History 

http://freebeacon.com/politics/study-nearly-all-hillary-clintons-tv-ads-didnt-discuss-policy/

so this Jr thing is not a real story compared to Podesta conspiring against Russia creating an entire story of collusion. It's just another smear.

Where as the DNC and neo-liberal (really right wing) media propaganda is actually regurgitatin a real conspiracy theory created by Hillary's campaign manager John Podesta that Russia was behind the Guccifer hack.

I care much more about democracy than you do.

You just hate Russia because your one sided neo-liberal media echo chamber which is really owned by a couple companies is telling you too.

The truth is that we don't live in democracy

A true democracy is created to give the majority of the population the right to dictate policy.

An oligarchy is when a handful of elites determine policy

a study done by Princeton and Northwestern Universty in 2004 that was later taught in classes in those schools claimed that America is an Oligarchy, not a Democracy.

A perfect example of this is SIngle Payer Health Insurance. The only people that gain from it not passing are at the top Wall Street, then the banks, then the pharma and insurance companies (the CEO of United makes $600,000 a day) then the plutocrats who vote against it like Corey Booker and all of the Republican Party

Another example of this is that Bernie Sanders is the only politician in America that has an approval rating above 50%.

If you want to know who is really running our country look no further than the attendees at this fourth of july holiday party over the Senate Recess, a completley bipartisan party of the richest and scummiest elites

2015,This is bad and you should feel bad.

Especially considering Kushner updating 100 ""forgotten"" foreign contacts, Sessions settling a money laundering scheme 2 days before the trial was supposed to start with the Russian lawyer that set up the meetings at Trump towers with Jr. and other campaign officials with the Clinton emails? The goal posts are now where the concession stands should be. We only have so many eyebrows that we can raise. You know?

Edit: you bring up all good points and I would hope Democrats get their jail as republicans. But republicans control everything now and its been a less than seamless transition."

2032,"what do you mean by collude though? Is getting dirt considered ""colluding""

because in that case Hillary did the same thing with the Ukranian head. Is that colluding?

I thought that was just Establishment politics as usual.

Collusion, to me infers a much grander conspiracy. Like the one Podesta hatched. Like the one Podesta was blaming on Trump last week, and still is on twitter?

Are we experiencing mass amnesia or what.. 

God damn propaganda works so good all you have to do is just cancel your cable and stop reading the Washington Post and the New York Times and Fox News and you effectively ""wake up"" and start thinking more like me. 

It's unbelievable. Of course if you are force fed burritos all day every day you're gonna fart out hot sauce but this blind patron Mcarthyism is about as embarrassing of millennials as is the baby boomers patronaging America into a muslim eradicating, evangelical and sociopathic neo-liberal elite utopia."
2033,"No, that is not the definition of science.  It is also not how science works.  You start with a theory but you do not test it until it's proven true, you test it until it proves true or false.  This is rather telling as to just how ignorant you are.  You think that if you chase after a theory eventually it will prove true regardless of facts.  Even one of your so called ""facts"" says it is ""Unproven"" (the Snopes link).

2037,"do you at least get paid decently for spending all your time pushing this shit narrative, or are you doing it voluntarily?"
2038,People in your campaign who are sought out to receive information from a foreign government during an election year about a candidate you're running against that includes one of Russia's top lawyer and a translator that is an ex spy? That doesn't sound suspicious at all. The most ironic thing about this is I agreed with you but you couldn't hear that because you were too busy jerking yourself off about how smart you are. And you didn't even touch on the things I mentioned. I fucking agreed with you! To see it as only right or wrong with no gray is incredibly stupid or incredibly lazy. I defer to your expertise.

2044,"voluntarily but its very hard because I can only post once every 10 minutes or so in politics so its very rare forme. This always happens in my life I find a conspiracy that to me is painfully obvious and shine light on it. I get called crazy. It gets proven true or not. Rinse, repeat, you just grow a hide to ignorance and apathy and blind patronage. And it's all really one conspiracy. Corporate cash is corrupting America. So I find solace in shining light on the truth. Right now the DNC is in my sights and I have lots and lots of evidence, I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up on the right side of this I don't think even Podesta can get through this big of a fuckup without jail time.

I get most of my info from Jimmy Dore by the way he is an ""aggressive progressive"" and I think he is legit, even though sometimes hes a bit wrong. Like he claims that we still make cluster bombs in RI but I think we just stopped as of September. But his heart is just in the right place, unlike the corporate shills like Rachel Maddow who get paid 30,000 a night to sit on camera and spew unproven Russia propaganda all day."
2045,"I never said that was a fact, I said that was a statement which aligns with the most current data, that the info was copied locally from a DNC computer onto a flash drive."

2366,"Sanders support is consistently fractural.  This is simply yet another excuse for running a bad campaign and yet another attempt to fragment the left as if enough damage wasn't already done.  In the primaries, millions of actual progressive Democrats voted for Clinton over Sanders because she had a BETTER  and MORE REALISTIC approach to many topics, such as reinvestment in higher education where as Bernie's idea was blame based.  And because she didn't start late. 

The economy needs to succeed as a whole. It doesn't succeed by punishing parts of it.   That's actually what Trump is doing in fact and it doesn't work. 

Claiming that there are more segments simply surrenders to a messed up, rag-tag but inseparable coaltion of: people who think they are neo-cons, ""peace loving"" libertarians,  ""free market"" Ryans, ""NON-FREE MARKET"" Hoover-Trumps and ""fiscal conservatives"" who vote for BIG MILITARY BUDGETS! 

That coalition will continue to stand together because a large faction of  the left wants to attack something different: THE LEFT!

And that right wing coalition will always win over a fragmented left. And every thing I ever read - not from Bernie Sanders, but from his VERY BITTER supporters indicates a desire to fragment the left even more and force us to lose.

I actually voted for Bernie Sanders because I felt he'd get straightened out eventually on higher ed by the rest of the party.  

But no more.  I'm tired of the constant bitter attempt to fragment and blame.  I've lost faith that a politician who is backed by bitter people can ever succeed. And though Bernie didn't believe in it, Bernies campaign was used as a way to fragment and attack the left - not to help any progressive cause. 

Eventually apparently Sanders also went negative on higher education.  So no more chances.  No more am I going to support a factional group who happens to have chosen a decent candidate but who ""wants out.""  Bernie was Ok but Bernie's movement led with Bernie's jaw.

Bernie's movement existed here on line and not in real life in the trenches in the state of New York. That's why he lost. Because people in New York didn't buy it.  It was a bad sales job.  I tried to help.  I tried to get Sanders people to focus on what they needed to do.

They didn't spend any time in NY.  In comparison, Donald Trump was criss-crossing the country in 2014.

It doesn't help for the campaign to never get going, to start late and then complain about ones opponent.

Two issues. 1. Sweden doesn't have single payer but it does have VERY AFFORDABLE universal healthcare.  2. Given the Republican opposition at this point, one would have to say she was right about that prediction.


>While she was way better than any Republican in the field, progressive voters want to see their politicians fight for more than just what is easily possible.

We did that. We got the ACA.  It was not ""easily possible"" and as result of doing that, we didn't create middle class jobs and we didn't do what Hillary Clinton suggested: spend money to retrain the workforce.

> If we didn't push for the impossible we'd still be riding horses,

If we were in the saddle we would.  But we're not. If we didn't push for the impossible, we might win the House of Representatives, we would have affordable tuition and we wouldn't be faced with Boehnerism today.

> Just a few short months after the election, there are now 114 Democrats in the House (out of 194) that support Medicare-For-All.

Medicare for all is one solution. It's quite possibly a good solution, but its not likely that enough Republican votes can be found to pass it and it will NEVER pass with a Republican majority.  We can constantly blame gerrymandering, but we can't blame the top of the ticket every time the left loses a legislature. 

>Hillary said it would never happen,

But at this point, she was right. And it isn't necessarily the only good way to succeed.
"
2379,And Trump does?

Republican voters are coming on board, after all, Trump lied on the campaign trail and said we would have health insurance for everyone, even those who couldn't afford it.

First we're going to take back majority from the Republicans. If Democrats fully support Medicare-For-All before the 2018 elections, maybe we'll be able to take the majority back in 2018. More likely it will take until 2020.

If the goal isn't Medicare-For-All, then it will never happen. If the party as a whole supports Medicare-For-All and they have the power of the people behind them, it **will** happen. Maybe by 2024. Maybe by 2030. But we need leaders who push for it."

2385,"> Very shortsighted.

Going from 18% of GDP to 9.3% for health care is ""short-sighted?"" The fact is Sweden's system is not single-payer and its less expensive.

Is it necessary to call THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN VOTERS ""short-sighted"" and continue to fracture the left instead of finding some way to form a coalition?

I mean Ted Cruz can find a way to have a coalition with Donald Trump.  I don't see why some progressives are so bitter?

>She wasn't right that it will never happen because we are pushing for it until it happens. 

This sentence doesn't make very much sense.  If we follow Sweden's model why is that wrong?

>Change always comes from the bottom up and the people are now demanding it. 

Well I don't see that. I see that W caused change from the top and we didn't stop it.  I saw the left become defensive and retreating instead of relentless.

We have to  start believing in ourselves and pushing good ideas instead of apologizing for them and instead of constantly second-guessing.  The pretense that Hillary Clinton didn't win a majority is what Trump wants.  It shouldn't be what people on the left want.

2403,"the bar is so low. ""as long it's not a crime, it's ok"""
2404,"If Jr went to a meeting expecting to have sex with a 14 year-old girl and got Chris Hansen instead, would we be saying ""he isn't guilty because nothing happened?""  

^^^No? ^^^Didn't ^^^think ^^^so.
"
2405,"Oh good. Some talking head at FOX has said-so, I guess we can cancel the House and Senate investigations and send Robert Mueller and his team home too. Looks like we'll never have to bother our judicial system with this matter after all.  Thanks for saving the American government all that time and effort, FOX rando."
2406,It's no loss to defend trump if you are fox. The viewership is stupid. You can tell them anything 
2407,"“Collusion has nothing to do with elections and political campaigns. Which renders special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation meaningless.”

This is as dull-witted and empty-headed as anything I have seen."
2408,"Of course not, Fox News. Because you'll print any old piece of shit."
2409," Donald Trump Jr accepted the meeting that Russian government offered the Hillary clinton dirt. He even said in email that he is going to  love it. The reason why he did not call the FBI was because they all were with Russians.
 
 "
2410,"We literally live in a world where Republicans will tolerate collusion with Russia.

Mr Gorbachev, tear down my political opponent."
2411,"So the main defense strategy is now seriously ""whatever he did it was not a crime"" and ""legally collusion only applies to price fixing"". Talks about grasping at straws. The purported crimes of Junior fall into the categories of campaign finance violations, coordination with a foreign power, aiding and abetting and conspiracy. No amount of price fixing deflection will make that go away. "
2412,"The case is being made that even if the worst thing we can think of-
Team Trump helping Russia deploy the stolen emails- is true, it's not a crime. 

And they say Republicans are patriots.

"
2413,"If you're arguing about legality, you're losing.

What is it with the Trump crime family and treason?"
2414,"I would recommend this article, this is surely the bottom of the pit. He's already preparing for whatever is about to come out next. There is no behavior that cannot be excused by this line of defense, this guy is all in, he can't ever turn on Trump."
2415,"... unless it's a crime to *love your father so much*!

<gag>"
2416,"this could set such a crazy precedent. Let's imagine for a moment, that they go with ""collusion isnt a crime."" And let's imagine that it works. Donnie Moscow gets away with this. Do you realize that all future elections will be decided by any and all other countries who decide they have a stake in the outcome? "
2417,Time to call james cameron...
2418,"Mr. Garrett claims to be a lawyer, FWIW. "
2419,Like the fredo meeting was a setup perpetrated by the DNC?
2420,You can even tell them that Trump paid Russian hookers to give him a golden shower on a bed Obama slept in.  Theyll believe anything!
2421,"It's not my view, but Gregg Jarrett seems to be arguing that there is no such crime as ""coordinating with a foreign power"", and I've read elsewhere that the idea that receiving information constitutes receiving ""something of value"" from a foreign power is just a theory that has never been tested legally."
2422,"If you ever care to, read Nietzsche's ""Genealogy of Morals."" Republicans have regressed to what he called Master and Slave morality. What ever power (master) does is moral and legal, whatever the slave does is immoral and a crime. "
2423,"> they say Republicans are patriots

and they’re all about the constitution and the rule of law."
2424,"I agree with you. The right is preparing for excusing collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The question is, what are we going to do about it?"
2425,"Oh, and Allan Dershowitz is basically making the same arguments, that none of the worst we can imagine constitutes a crime. The only crime would be if the Trump campaign did the hacking or solicited the hacking."
2426,"Every conservative would support the act and a video would make no difference.

Deep down inside every conservative wants to do that.

They see themselves as Trump.

That's a pretty fat, lying, disgusting image."
2427,And also that Seth Rich's murder was a cover up by the DNC
2428,Pizzagate!

2430,Don’t forget the Bible!
2431,"Well, the smitey, vengeful bits, at least."
2432,"Right. Definitely none of the preachy Jesus bits, that guy is a freaking communist."
2433,">The White House, State Department and Pentagon were watching in real time when a mortar strike killed two Americans at the CIA’s annex in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the House Select Committee on Benghazi said last week.

BREAKING NEWS!!! Obama could have stopped those mortar rounds by flying his drone to intercept but *he was too busy putting dijon on a burger and wasn't holding the controller*."
2434,World tribune is the news source that bridges the news gap between the Washington Times and the Weekly World News. They will be the best news source if we are ever attacked by vampire terrorists 
2435,We’ll get you next time Ben Gacey!!!!
2436,Wow - desperation reins
2437,"Dozens of investigations conducted by the GOP.

ZERO wrongdoing found."
2438,Thanks. I almost forgot. Never again. 
2439,I've never seen anyone successful explain what authority Hillary had to issue the supposed stand-down order to the military and why they would have taken the order from someone not in their chain of command.
2440,"Ooh, a bingo!  I got a bingo.  Seth rich, emails, Obama did it, Soros, Benghazi!  About time.  I was wondering when all the same excuses would come churning around again.  When is it all going to repeat next?

2445,I can't believe I have not read one commentary explicitly point out that it was in everyone's personal interest in the room to lie about the purpose of the meeting in Trump tower.  If any of the people in the room admitted that they spoke in about the things in the email they would be committing a major felony and go to jail for s long time.  They have no choice but to lie about the purpose if the meeting.

She was obviously in the country for the duration of the case, from her original entry in late 2015 until the settlement in May 2017. During this time, the meeting took place with Don Jr, Kushner and Manafort in June 2016.

The only real mystery here is why the Trump administration decided to settle a $230 million fraud case for a Russian company, represented by the very same Russian lawyer involved in the collusion meeting, for a $6 million settlement with no admission of guilt and no seizure of assets.

Correct but there are no specifics on how that happened. The instance this article is talking about is a reasonable reason why she was given a special waiver. Which are designed for this exact purpose. 

I also find it disingenuous to blame Obama administration for not stopping Jr from meeting with this lawyer. That is like blaming the Cops for not stopping a bank robber before he actually robs the bank.  "
2580,"You've got the timeline wrong. This article is discussing things that happened in 2015 and 2016, and the case wasn't settled until this year.

I do agree the sudden settlement of the case that was about to go to trial is curious though. Weird how Jeff Sessions's DOJ was ready to let her client off the hook so easily."
2581,"This article provides some good insight

http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/341788-exclusive-doj-let-russian-lawyer-into-us-before-she-met-with-trump"
2582,"It's in the article above, which evidently you haven't even bothered to read. Literally the 2nd bullet point below the title says:

>In late 2015, she was granted special permission by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch to enter the United States even though she didn't have a visa.

The article later points to [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/341788-exclusive-doj-let-russian-lawyer-into-us-before-she-met-with-trump) as the source of this information. The Hill article then has this specific paragraph:

>The Moscow lawyer had been turned down for a visa to enter the U.S. lawfully but then was **granted special immigration parole** by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch **for the limited purpose of helping a company owned by Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, her client, defend itself against a Justice Department asset forfeiture case in federal court in New York City**.

Which is exactly what I said above -- that this woman was given a special permit to represent a client in a US court case. [That court case was settled just two months ago, in May 2017](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/reuters-america-us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case.html). 

It stands to reason then that the lawyer representing this case would be remaining in the country from her original *legal* entry in late 2015 under a special waiver until the conclusion of the case in May 2017. 

The meeting with Don Jr in June 2016 falls squarely within this late 2015 to May 2017 time frame.

There's no mystery here. She was here legally for a legal reason, and she met Don Jr during that period."
2583,"Ok so why did they let a ""Russian government operative"" in?"
2584,"Because at the time she was given this waiver **back in 2015**, nobody had any fucking clue what Russia was planning with jts interference in the campaign. Remember, the counter intelligence investigation didn't start until late summer of 2016.  At the time in 2015, she had a legitimate reason to be in the country, with regards to the court case she was working on as a legal counsel. Obviously there wasn't any Intel to indicate she was going to do something like this. 

Seriously why is this obvious situation such a mystery to you? Its very clear that she was allowed in for legitimate reasons, but engaged know illegitimate activities during her otherwise legal stay."
2585,"Deflect much?    Hillary isn't the president.   Trump is president,   definitely the more pressing of the two issues."
2586,From the house appropriations committee that now has to pass through both houses of Congress and won't survive because it's the dumbest fucking thing.
2587,1.6 billion won't fund a 20+ billion dollar wall. 
2588,"From Mexico, right? Did he get that funding from Mexico, like he promised?"
2589,"I've said it once and I'll say it again. 

Nothing says ""fiscal conservative"" like spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money seizing private property for a massive federal government project that all data tells us will be ineffective at achieving its ultimate goal. "
2590,"Wait, so it isn't going to be a 30 billion dollar wall and isn't going to be funded by Mexico...doesn't sound like he won, at all."
2591,"""4 People agree on bill to fund less than 1% of the yet to be started border wall, Trumps biggest win yet"""
2592,Plus GOP blocked language that would have prevented military funds from being used for Trump's Stupid Wall. They want to be free to use funds allocated to the military for this boondoggle.
2593,If this is a big win then wtf does losing look like? 
2594,"I mean, you can say it's the ""dumbest fucking thing"" but the GOP is going to just reply with ""hold my beer""."
2595,"Yeah, this is one piece of the appropriations process, no funds are allocated yet. But that's what you get with a presidency that cares more about PR than policy."
2596,If you put it all on black a few times it will.
2597,"It will build a wall, it's just going to only be 3 feet tall.

Exhaustive research indicates that any wall shorter than a ladder is equally effective, so there's really no practical reason to go higher."
2598,"> all data tells us will be ineffective at achieving its ultimate goal. 

Really? How will it be ineffective at getting our tax money into the pockets of Trump friendly (and likely Trump invested) construction companies? 

Oh wait, you mean the *stated* goal. Never mind. "
2599,"Most of the GOP Senators don't support the wall, because they are traditionally conservative. 

Trump isn't tho, he's Trump, and in the end, although the wall is not the most fiscally responsible endeavor, trump literally won on it's promise. The party has no choice but to respect the promise the President made to the American people.

2604,Nah you gotta play it risky and put it on an individual number. Then if you win you might actually have enough money to fund the wall.
2605,"If the party leader and the party's voters are abandoning fiscal conservatism, then they can't continue to call themselves a fiscally conservative party. "
2606,"This whole argument is a giant straw man. I at no point claimed to be a fiscal conservative, nor would I ever claim that. I was pointing out the utter hypocrisy of Republicans claiming to be fiscally conservative. And at least Obama increased spending to try to give Americans affordable healthcare rather than build a useless wall.

2655,"The DOJ gave Natalia Veselnitskaya a special waiver for the specific and limited purpose of aiding in the legal defense of a Russian businessman Denis Katsyv against a Justice Department asset forfeiture case in federal court in New York City.

Under this waiver, Veselnitskaya *legally* entered the country in late 2015, and remained in the country until [the case was settled just two months ago in May 2017](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/reuters-america-us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case.html).

Her meeting with Don Jr, Kushner and Manafort took place in June 2016, smack in the middle of this legal and justified stay in the US.

I don't see what the mystery or scandal is here. She entered and stayed here for a legitimate reason. She engaged in illegitimate activities during her stay, of course, but that's on her, not the DOJ nor the Obama administration.

If you really want to discuss something super shady, let's discuss how the $230 million fraud case that this woman worked on was mysteriously and abruptly settled *by the Trump administration* for $6 million, no admission of guilt, and no asset seizures. Sounds like a pretty big gift handed to a Russian businessman by our government."
2656,"Oh I see this is all Obama's fault. He should have had inside knowledge that the reason the Russian Lawyer was coming to America was to help Trump win the election. 

Because Obama was personally aware of every single person who traveled to America's reason for coming to America right?

If Only Obama hadn't allowed Trump to cheat in the election. Damn him!"

2700,Obama is a genius like the Joker in the Dark Knight where every single piece has to play exactly as it does or it all literally falls apart.
2701,"In the email from one of Trump's Russian business partners (Trump does business with Russia now?):

2702,"Two problems with your statement:

1. No one knew that at the time.
2. That's according to Jr., who lied about the meeting in the first place."
2703,You understand just days after their meeting Russia (Guccifer 2.0) announced out of the blue they hacked the DNC and would release the emails soon.
2704,"But if Obama entrapped them, why didn't we hear about it until 8 months after the election?"
2705,"She claimed to in the email. Why do you think that the originating topic of the meeting is claimed to not have been discussed at the meeting? It seems to me that it would have been at least discussed, even if to just mention it was all fabricated and does not exist."
2706,It's all they've got sadly. 
2707,"No, I think Don Jr. saw an opportunity for dirt and didn't really concern himself with the ""foreign agent"" or ""something of value"" aspect.  The information was supposedly about financial ties in Russia to Hillary and the DNC, knowledge of which would clearly be in the American public's interest.  Hard to make a case for treason on that.  There may have been a legal blunder if you really stretch the legal definition of ""something of value"", but nothing nefarious.

2747,"It would be so ironic of people on the right became vocal advocates for ""deviant"" sexual fetishes and started saying stuff like ""what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business and shouldn't concern you"". And it would be even more hilarious to then see them do mental gymnastics to still be against gay sex and try to make that argument work. If the person tape exists, this is indeed the most that will come of it but the reaction and cognitive dissonance will certainly be interesting."

2762,">In particular, federal spending for health care would be much lower than the amounts in CBO’s baseline, as would outlays for war- related programs and for many nondefense purposes. Revenues also would be lower than baseline amounts under the President’s proposals, offsetting some of the deﬁcit reduction achieved by the spending cuts.

Any assumption where taxes are cut while defense spending goes up is a lie. Same is true without massive cuts to Social Security, Welfare (TANF and SNAP) and Medicare. There is no possible way the deficit would get reduced to balanced without higher taxes and spending cuts. Then we get into debt reduction, which is another proposition to begin with. 

We have been screwing with tax relief for the 5% at the expense of programs that lift the 95%. The only way to get our house in order is to greatly change the tax codes, reduce spending and drive economic growth. One of those levers alone will not do the trick.

2766,"Al Gore headed a study to investigate what would happen if the deficit was erased because the deficit would have been zeroed by 2007 on the budgets that Bill Clinton's administration had set, which Gore would have continued had he been elected. Of course it is all history now as Gore lost. Neither Trump nor his administration has the political credibility, the intelligence to design a budget, the compassion needed to make the correct cuts, nor the quality of majority elected officials to devise a long term budget to do this safely, kindly, or smartly the way that Clinton did in his tenure.

2878,And C. completely lacking in any foreign relations experience or education.
2879,The Democrats' bench is so deep right now it is insane. And unlike the Republican bench in 2016 that was full of every corrupt governor who looted his state and every lunatic senator; the Democrats that are emerging as powerhouses are amazing. They are brilliant former prosecutors and outstanding Senators. They make their Republican counterparts look like rubes. 
2880,Dems don't win with old candidates. Younger the better.
2881,Harris/Hickenlooper 2020
2882,"it's early for this but yeah of course he might.

It's a leaderless opposition party running against a deeply unpopular president (assuming that trend holds).

Like two million democrats are going to run for president."
2883,"He wouldn't win.
He's a bit of a media-whore."
2884,Democrats can't hold a candle to the GOP - if measured in man years dedicated to the dairy science field.   
2885,"The GOP has guys like Cruz and Rubio running for President in their 40s - we could see both of them try again in _2040_ or possibly later. They (and others) are nationally branded by being darlings of the party, regulars on Fox News, and by making big press statements or running for President. 

The problem with the Dem bench is that everyone on it is old. Of all the figureheads of the American Left, Barack Obama is still one of if not the youngest. They didn't field anyone against him in 2012, and they purposefully boxed out everyone within the party so Clinton could take it in 2016 - with the assumption that she'd be unchallenged for reelection in 2020. The DNC has gone almost a decade without grooming or giving spotlight to any young talent - a huge mistake when the successful progressives around the world are young like Trudeau (45) and Macron (39). 

Youth sells change. American liberalism's most youthful public figure is a 75-year-old Senator from Vermont. 
"
2886,"The funny thing is, everyone thought the GOP bench prior to 2016 *was* deep and stacked. Rubio, Walker, Paul, Kasich, Christie, and even Jeb were considered to be strong contenders. 

Once the spotlight is put on candidates, plenty of them fail to live up to expectations. I suspect that will be true for a lot of these 2020 contenders as well."

2891,"Adam Schiff is outstanding. So is Al Franken. So is Jeff Merkeley and Ron Wyden. Kamala Harris is brand new but killing it. Tammy Duckworth isn't too shabby either. It seems to me that Ted Lieu is also trying to run for president. 

The sad thing is these are all outstanding people and they will be running against lunatics and the race will practically be a tie all the way to the end. 

Republicanism is a religion now. "
2892,"Trudeau and Macron aren't great examples. Trudeau came from a famous political family which is kind of a one-off. Macron is not progressive in any sense of the word - he ran on an Obama-esque campaign where his platform was all about change and overhauling politics as usual. He basically ran as a moderate who stole votes from both the Socialist Party and Les Republicains (conservative party).

I think there are lessons to be taken from both of them, but not one of progressive politics. Both of them are fairly young, camera-friendly, and ran on a platform of change (which is obviously correlated with being relative newcomers to the political scene). But I think a moderate Democrat, more of an Obama type candidate, could use these lessons just as much as a progressive Democrat could."

Gore, Hillary, and Romney couldn't do it. I wasn't alive for it, but my understanding of Eisenhower vs Adlai Stevenson was that Eisenhower was seen as more relatable to average Americans while Stevenson was seen as a stuffy intellectual snob."

2906,"A Democrat is not ""dead in the water"" for being strongly pro gun control. People who worry about this a lot vote R and aren't changing. It's like saying a Republican is dead in the water because he said bad things about immigrants."
2907,"Ted Cruz and John McCain weren't born in the United States. I think Duckworth has a chance

"
2908,"2 prosecutors? still a bit narrow imo and not nearly vocal enough on economic issues/healthcare

Ask yourself this: Do Democrats expect to win those midwest states with liberal prosecutors who have no economic bona fides?"
2909,"I'd rather not see a Senate seat opened just to put her on the SCOTUS. Obama lined up hundreds of judges of similar slant, ready to be nominated and then replaced by Presidential appointees. "
2910,"I (respectfully) think you are wrong.  You've got it backwards.  Dems are not going to vote Republican over gun policy.  Republicans on the other hand are dealing with a party which has more or less left them behind, and guns are among the last things they have left to offer for rural America.

Guns and abortion are the two biggest wedge issues.  If the Dems choose to roll with a uniform, sane gun policy instead of (appearing to) killing the 2A by a thousand cuts, they will eat the Republican's lunch and push the NRA to the fringe where it belongs.

I think something along the lines of:

* Background checks for permits.  Don't incorporate not-fly lists or anything else which violates due process.

* Permits let you buy anything semiautomatic

* No central registries (let licensed vendors keep logs and respond to individual queries - like Google may respond to a warrant for someone's emails - with the option to fight overly broad requests)

* No restrictions on attachments or capacities.

* Allow any property to be posted weapon-free at owner's digression."
2911,"I'm just a bit fed up with corruption at this point, and think a very strong platform on that would sell very well with the Democratic base. Do agree now that it may be overly narrow though. I hope both of these people run even though I know it would be really unlikely for Sally Yates to jump in.

Yates isn't exactly a super liberal person as far as I'm aware, she comes from my state - Georgia - and has worked under both democratic and republican administrations before her showdown with Trump"
2912,"Ah, but you're forgetting the fact that the NRA and Republicans will lie about the Democrats' gun policy anyway even if it is reasonable"
2913,"A pro-gun or anti-abortion Dem *might* pick up a few former Republicans, but it's going to cost them far more in terms of alienated progressive voters who are pushed to vote 3rd party... and on that note, they'd have no chance in the D primary in the first place.

Your argument might make sense for a House or Senate candidate in a purple state, but not for a national election. The numbers don't work."
2914,"Yeah you're probably right about Yates. I doubt she wants to even run. I mean, she was just doing her job and got mad praise for it. Nothing wrong inherently with that - it's respectable - but she hasn't done anything to say that she wants to run for elected office.

Kamala, otoh, is a strong contender. I agree with the anti corruption idea and she would fit into that. Maybe I'll get some flak for this but my personal opinion is that Bernie should run with her as VP. He's got the trust of the people, she's a lot younger and has good relations with the party. (Not too mention her credentials which are only short on experience at the federal level, which vp would give her)"
2915,"Yeah, the things that makes Yates so great are the same reasons she'd stay so far away.

I'm game for Harris with Sanders as VP, but I still think we need to wipe the slate clean from 2016. Clinton and Sanders have both missed their shots in the last election, if you ask me. Still, she definitely needs an experienced pick to balance the ticket like Biden did for Obama.


Is there anyone cut from the same cloth as Sanders or Biden, but maybe 5 or 10 years younger?"
2916,"Hmm deflection to Clinton again. Perhaps try a new approach because this Clintion stuff reeks of desperation. I hear Sen Warren is going to be the rights new boogeyman so maybe post some fake news about her, change it up a bit."
2917,"Is 42 pages really a document ""dump""? I'd call it more of a document shart."

2919,"I sent a buddy who is a die hard Trumpster the Donny Jr. email chain and you know what he fucking said?  ""I wonder what dirt Russia has on Clinton"" and I lost my shit. Even if Putin himself filmed Trump getting pissed on by underage girls these people would find a way to justify it. We are kidding ourselves if we think there's reasoning with that kind of stupid. "

2921,"Well, if conservatives really think she needs to be charged, prosecuted and punished, they should actually do something about it. They look pretty weak and ineffective by letting Crooked Hillary, the most corrupt politician of our times, simply walk away scot free after trashing our Constitution. It's kinda strange that they aren't pressuring Trump to lock her up. It's almost as if they know they don't have a case against her."

Of course they weren't, because Lynch's marching orders came from the Boss, and he would have been the one to fire them.

Btw - collusion - not illegal.  It wasn't illegal when Barry campaigned for the Remain side of Brexit, and it wasn't illegal when Hillary colluded with Ukraine or a Venezuelan ex-pat.

https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/why-markets-cant-cure-healthcare/?mcubz=0

> Not so. One of the most influential economic papers of the postwar era was Kenneth Arrow’s Uncertainty and the welfare economics of health care, which demonstrated — decisively, I and many others believe — that health care can’t be marketed like bread or TVs. Let me offer my own version of Arrow’s argument.

> There are two strongly distinctive aspects of health care. One is that you don’t know when or whether you’ll need care — but if you do, the care can be extremely expensive. The big bucks are in triple coronary bypass surgery, not routine visits to the doctor’s office; and very, very few people can afford to pay major medical costs out of pocket.

> This tells you right away that health care can’t be sold like bread. It must be largely paid for by some kind of insurance. And this in turn means that someone other than the patient ends up making decisions about what to buy. Consumer choice is nonsense when it comes to health care. And you can’t just trust insurance companies either — they’re not in business for their health, or yours.

> This problem is made worse by the fact that actually paying for your health care is a loss from an insurers’ point of view — they actually refer to it as “medical costs.” This means both that insurers try to deny as many claims as possible, and that they try to avoid covering people who are actually likely to need care. Both of these strategies use a lot of resources, which is why private insurance has much higher administrative costs than single-payer systems. And since there’s a widespread sense that our fellow citizens should get the care we need — not everyone agrees, but most do — this means that private insurance basically spends a lot of money on socially destructive activities."

3065,o you sweet summer children
3066,Do these idiots not realize that it's Robert meuller that will be convicting trump and his administration and not the court of public opinion or the media? All the hype or lack of hype around these bombshells means nothing.

3071,Atta boy. Fire up that gaslight with accusations of xenophobia so that everyone gets distracted from Trump Jr. lying about the ex-spy attending the meeting. You'll save the day yet!

3073,"OH man, you're right! We in fact are the racist ones, not Trump who says that Mexico is sending their rapists and murders!

All this time, I had imagined that Russia was sending ONLY spies and agents. And some, I assume are good people.

For your health:
>NBC News reported Friday that some U.S. officials suspect the former intelligence officer of having ongoing ties to Russian intelligence.

3075,"an ex-soviet inteligence agent does not just unlearn their intelligence skills nor remain unsymphathetic to their former nation

racism and xenophobia have nothing to do with this"
3076,"Its not unheard of for citizens to go against their country. For Russia to implant long term assets here (citizens living a life as a married couple who are really spies. Seriously, it's happened). Or for people to break oathes. As far as people changing? Possible. But it's not xenophobic on any level.

First of all the guy is white, America is mostly white. White people don't fear white people. Secondly intelligence officer is a job, not a creed. Its perfectly rational to suspect someone who was a spy their whole life might have alterior motives getting involved in politics of ANY country. 

In short, people aren't worried because thus guy is Russian. They're worried because he was a former spy. If he owned a bakery in Russia nobody would have cared"

I still appreciate Kid Rock (only 30 though), saw him at Carolina Rebellion a few years back and he put on one of the best shows of the entire weekend.  That being said, I wouldn't vote for him unless extreme circumstances dictated it (e.g. if his opponent was Trump, or someone like-minded).

The only true democrat that held office in your list is Franken, who got politically involved many years prior to actually running for office to kind of learn the ropes.

The rest of them are republicans or independents.  Not to be too condescending, but does that not say that democrats hold their candidates to a higher standard, and vote on that standard instead of TV personalities?  Democracy is a popularity contest, by nature, and that one party picks qualified candidates whereas the other picks TV/music/WWE personalities is striking to me.  Kid Rock getting the nomination would cement that stereotype in my brain.

I would also argue that the jury is pretty fucking set on Trump at this point.  I have virtually zero doubt that he will go down as one of the 5 worst presidents of all time, if not the worst.

Curiously, to your first comment about Kid Rock...I honestly can't place him either.  Socially quite progressive on some fronts, regressive on others.  Fiscally conservative for sure.  Stating he likes Trump on the surface tells me all I need to know...but he could also be pandering to his fans, which are largely (and I say this as someone who enjoys me Kid Rock) poor white trash, and tend to vote republican.

 "
3108,"That's fine.  I try to keep a level head and see both sides of the coin, but I really just...can't spin it any other way.  I am 100% convinced at this point.

Ignoring the ongoing scandal...

-The tweets.  My god, the tweets.  Tweeting pro-Trump stuff from Fox and Friends, and tweeting ""fake news!"" every time there's something negative about him.

-The international embarrassment.  World leaders meeting with Trump are now making fun of his trademark handshake.  The fact that he does this special handshake in the first place is embarrassing enough.  I wish the handshake was the worst of it all...the fact that he called Taiwan, pissing off China, is bad.  The fact that he chose to call/meet with Edrogan/Deuterte is also bad...yes, let's call the dictators who are being called out on their oppression of citizens FIRST, rather than our trade partners, allies, and neighbors. The climate change denial is also fucking ridiculous.

-Even if you agree with him politically (build wall! prosecute Hillary! spend on infrastructure!  kill ACA!), which I do not, he's been ABYSMAL AT IT.  He has a majority in the house and senate.  The 6 month bipartisan budget that got passed with a veto-proof majority a couple months ago...it increased NIH funding (he wanted to cut it), NASA funding (he wanted to cut it), did not cut planned parenthood funding (he wanted to cut it), got a 5% military budget increase (he wanted 10%), zero border wall funding...and I'm just scratching the surface.  That damn budget came out and I was terrified to look through it...then I saw it and was like ""holy shit!  he got like...nothing he wanted!""  On top of that, the immigration ban (which is months past it's original expiration date) only recently got reinstated, and only part of it.  And it's only reinstated until SCOTUS reviews it, at which point they will almost certainly strike down most, if not all of it.  As for Hillary's prosecution, he's openly admitted that it was just campaign rhetoric.  And that trillion dollar infrastructure plan?  We've not heard anything about it really.  So from a legislative perspective, he's been garbage.  The only things he's accomplished are through executive orders, which he was super critical of Obama about.

Meanwhile, despite being in the honeymoon phase, even the most republican leaning polls (Rassumen, Fox News) have his disapproval well over 50% on average.

I can go on...we could talk about his criticism of Hillary being on the side of wall street.  Then he goes and appoints a bunch of goldman sachs people to his cabinet.  He's even talking about replacing the head of the Fed with a GS person next year.

I say all of this, and I'm not even bringing up the Russia thing, which is kind of the massive elephant in the room, but I intentionally ignore it at the risk of you thinking I'm a shill/hack.

So, I know we're only like...5 or 6 months in.  But this is ridiculous.  Crap approval rating.  Can't pass ANYTHING he had planned, even by a republican controlled congress.  Making embarrassing and/or stupid mistakes on the international stage.  Backtracking on numerous campaign promises.  About the only thing he's been able to do is get Gorsuch in SCOTUS, and that's really more of McConnell's doing than Trump's.

So, respond or not, please at least appreciate that I've written all of this TRYING to not be partisan, but rather objective.  What I've written out really can't be more non-biased....it just...is.

3162,"Single Payer may indeed be where we end up. But a main concern has to be healthcare costs in general, as this is one of the underlying forces that drive end costs to the individual. There are two sides to healthcare cost; cost to individuals and costs that impact the coverage plan. No matter what plan we have in place, single payer, market place, employer or private, the cost of those plans will continue to rise unless we manage healthcare costs in general. There is no way that individuals escape an impact. Healthcare has to be paid for either directly as individuals out of our own pockets or collectively as in taxes to support a government run plan."
3163,"> the cost of those plans will continue to rise unless we manage healthcare costs in general.

* In addition, Fahrenthold found that Trump had used $258,000 of the foundation’s money to settle lawsuits that involved his private, for-profit businesses. That included a lawsuit by a golfer who claimed Trump had reneged on a $1 million prize in a hole-in-one contest at one of Trump’s golf clubs in 2010. Trump settled with the golfer: The charity paid $158,000.

* The foundation also gave $25,000 in 2013 to a political group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R). The donation came around the time Bondi’s office was considering whether to join a multistate fraud investigation against Trump University on behalf of Florida residents. Bondi eventually decided not to join the effort.

* The biggest donation that the Trump foundation ever gave $264,631,  appears to have been to  fix a fountain outside of the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time."

Actually, Treason is technically only a crime during wartime apparently. This would be Conspiracy to rig an American election or conspiracy of other sorts. "
3284,so they're doubling down on going full absurd as a defense?
3285,"I know there isn't enough evidence for treason yet and it would be very tough to prove but there are many definitions for treason.

>A. the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.

>B. the action of betraying someone or something.

>C. the betrayal of one's own country by waging war against it or by consciously or purposely acting to aid its enemies.

But the constitution lays it out pretty well:

>Under Article III, Section 3, of the Constitution, any person who levies war against the United States *or adheres to its enemies by giving them Aid and Comfort* has committed treason within the meaning of the Constitution. The term aid and comfort refers to any act that manifests a betrayal of allegiance to the United States, such as furnishing enemies with arms, troops, transportation, shelter, or classified information. If a *subversive act has any tendency to weaken the power of the United States to attack or resist its enemies, aid and comfort has been given.*

Now I'm no expert in the field of psychology but I think Don King is nuts. I get the point he is trying to make, it's fairly clear.

> A recent study from the Media Research Center, however, shows that broadcast media are disconnected from viewers, pushing the media’s own agenda more than representing the public’s interests. MRC data show well over half of all news coverage of the Trump administration on the evening newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC over a five week period focused on the probe of Russian influence in the 2016 election.

> The big networks spent 353 minutes covering the Russia investigation, but, for example, only 29 minutes on terrorism. The networks combined to spend only five minutes on the economy and jobs, and only three minutes on Trump’s plans to improve the nation’s infrastructure.

3 min on not existing plans that should be there is too much about substance and too little about the lack of policy. Don't even start thinking about the t....... word statement.

>The revelation that Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted an offer to meet with an individual described as a “Russian government attorney” bringing “official documents and information” to help the Trump campaign and injure the Clinton campaign is a bombshell.

>It raises a host of potential criminal and other legal violations for Donald Jr. and others involved, including his brother-in-law Jared Kushner; Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time; and perhaps the president himself. These new facts are a critical inflection point in the Trump-Russia matter.

Red areas in my state *constantly* complain about ""their"" tax dollars being spent in the city. Asshole - there would not be roads in Grant County, Washington if Seattle didn't pay for them.

Southern states that would be third world countries without blue state tax dollars are constantly trying to sabotage the Democratic programs that keep them alive.

This isn't true at all - it is short sighted and narrow minded by a blowhard with an agenda.

Why do blue states want to keep more tax revenue?  To fund the arts, to fund infrastructure programs, to prioritize space exploration over wars, to fund universal healthcare...

In other words, it is not that we want to retain money to hoard it like some republican... we want it to put it to the best use to HELP those most people, not enrich the already rich.

Um, no we can't - Texas is heavily dependent on federal funds."

Unless ""Bluexit"" comes with a plan to relocate all the poor people from red states into blue states, its going to be a net transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. I sincerely doubt there is such a plan, because urban liberals have established an extremely poor track record of allowing enough housing in their cities over the last few decades."

Fix your own god damn problems.

With that being said, I hope this at least scares the republicans into maybe pursuing impeachment on the grounds of 'obstruction of justice' (which now is pretty much proven) or breaking the emoluments clause of the constitution.

It may not even run afoul of campaign finance laws that prevent US candidates from accepting money or something of ""value"" from foreign nationals or governments...the sticky point being what's the legal definition of ""something of value""?  While one could say oppo research is valuable, if we restrict the scope of the law, value may just refer to gifts or favors with tangible monetary worth.

So if it's not treason, what is it?  What do we call it?  I think it's safe to say that it feels like treason...seeking the aid of a foreign power to help subvert a fellow citizen or the the entire nation for personal gain...certainly would warrant some kind of harsh societal punishment.

I'm not confused about who did what. Donald Jr is really not my concern. Imprisoning him or finding him guilty is not personally what would save our country from his father. However, his actions could very well lead to more discoveries down the road and certainly have hurt his father's standing and that of the republican party. Therefore, this could provide some more political pressure to go after Donald Trump *Sr.* for crimes he has already committed. He's been breaking the emoluments clause for some time now and firing James Comey was very clearly obstruction of justice.

I don't think that is technically a crime. If they had hacked the voting machines and we had proof Trump was colluding with that (also possible, I don't reject any of this as possible with these clown), then yes. The one thing I could see, is that you could make a case that the DTJ should have known that anything received from the Russians had to be stolen. But he is an idiot, so playing dumb may actually work, making it harder to prove intent on that. However, that is the best possibility I can see. I wouldn't consider it a slam dunk though.

What? I'm just giving an honest take as free of my own biases as I can. I'm not just gonna say something is illegal because I hate the guy. It has to actually be illegal. I also think you should pick your battles. Saying everything he does is a crime (especially when it isn't) only numbs the public's reaction to the actual crimes. It's bad optics that will backfire.

3606,"I have this cool thing - it is called ""data"" and you can use it to determine whether your pre-existing beliefs are correct and supported by evidence:

Here is a link to a [nice chart](http://college-education.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005532) that explains some of the issues we are facing, as you can see, adjusted for inflation:

* From 1971 to 2015 tuition for public colleges increased 276%
* Median income was essentially stagnant from 1971 to 2015
* As a result, tuition as a percentage of income increased from 7% to 25% for men and 20% to 39% for women.

The increasing tuition and stagnant income also means that student loans are more likely to be necessary to afford college, since college is no longer something you can simply pay for on a part time job. Student loans (which average 5-7% interest if you receive Federal Student loans) ultimately cost more because of accumulated interest.

It is clear that this generation is severely economically disadvantaged when it comes to obtaining a degree compared to previous generations.

That ignores surrounding issues like: a low minimum wage and degree inflation (more education required for higher salaried jobs than previous generations). It is no longer a choice between not going to college and getting a decent job and going to college and getting a high paying job. If you don't go to college, you are likely to have a poor paying job. And if you go to college, you need a full B.A./B.S. or graduate degrees to get a meaningful career, rather than simply an A.S. as you may have needed in the past. 

The data for these charts was from the Census and College Board."
3607,"[Take a look at the ""study"" if you want](http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IFS-MillennialSuccessSequence-Final.pdf). It explicitly says that following the ""sequence"" seems to lead to financial success. But it doesn't seem to control for factors other than ethnic background. Things like socioeconomic status, parent's education, I would expect to also correlate strongly. It also totally ignores the more important question of *why* millennials may be less likely to follow the sequence. My guess is things like fear of crippling education debt, lack of full time job opportunities at entry level, etc, would be big factors. So the sequence breaking may be *caused* by the poor economy, rather than causing the lack of financial success. The report almost seems to imply there's something inherently lazy or immoral about millenials causing them to fail, ignoring societal factors.

The cost for jobs that are based on experience and a little education on the other hand has less impact from the cost of higher education. 

So when you factor in the cost of education it is probably better to be a plumber than a manager at a company. The manager might make a little more but has a large loan to pay off while the plumber doesn't.

The reason that certain specific professional fields pay at a higher rate with lower education is because there is a shortage of labor in those fields. Positions like registered nurses, HVAC repair, or plumbing. If we diverted 5% of the general college population into those specific fields, the wages in those fields would drop substantially. They are bubbles. "
3614,"No, my problem is exactly that they misrepresented the data. They said that A causes B, because they correlate statistically... but they didn't control for C, D, and E that could also be causing B. They also didn't even examine whether B could be causing A.

It's an incredibly misleading way to use the underlying BLS statistics. There's a ton of value in trying to critically interpret statistics provided by government agencies such as the BLS. But it's also easy to spin statistics to present a message that follows your agenda, even if the statistics don't actually support that conclusion.

3615,"Lol

Yeah, college education is not in a bubble. Do you even think about what you write?

You also missed the point. If a job is in demand you have better prospects in that field than getting a degree where the field is already saturated with new college graduates and a larger portion of the previous generations staying in the field because they can't afford to retire.

One job needs people, the other can pick and choose out of a ton of applicants and many of them have more experience than you.

Not at all. I said I can't say with certainty that they are *wrong*. I would say that same thing about any claim that I haven't researched or read about. To claim someone is incorrect without any analysis and research on my part would be equally misleading.

That does not mean I am saying they could be correct. It just says I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to make an authoritative statement one way or the other. But if I had to make an educated guess, I would speculate that it is incorrect, for reasons such as the economic factors mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6muofn/new_report_says_millennials_are_broke_because/dk4h6pf/).

Edit: Fig. 1 - [Washington Times story about the firm that created the dossier, with not a single mention of the fact that they were hired by the RNC originally.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/11/democrats-spread-false-russian-information-on-trum/)

To starve them of their clicks, here's the text of the article.

>While the mainstream news media hunts for evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, the public record shows that Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump and attack his administration.
The disinformation came in the form of a Russian-fed dossier written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. It contains a series of unverified criminal charges against Mr. Trump’s campaign aides, such as coordinating Moscow’s hacking of Democratic Party computers.
Some Democrats have widely circulated the discredited information. Mr. Steele was paid by the Democrat-funded opposition research firm Fusion GPS with money from a Hillary Clinton backer. Fusion GPS distributed the dossier among Democrats and journalists. The information fell into the hands of the FBI, which used it in part to investigate Mr. Trump’s campaign aides.
Mr. Steele makes clear that his unproven charges came almost exclusively from sources linked to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He identified his sources as “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure,” a former “top level Russian intelligence officer active inside the Kremlin,” a “senior Kremlin official” and a “senior Russian government official.”
The same Democrats who have condemned Russia’s election interference via plying fake news and hacking email servers have quoted freely from the Steele anti-Trump memos derived from creatures of the Kremlin.
In other words, there is public evidence of significant, indirect collusion between Democrats and Russian disinformation, a Trump supporter said."
3643,But that oppo research didn't go to the Republican who ordered it.  Trump was never vetted by Republicans during the primaries which is one actual reason we are in such a screwed up mess. Trump was such a joke lose candidate that everybody discounted the power of late smears and social media bots. The Republicans showed how they govern by how they elected.
3644,"How long before he holds another ""lock her up"" rally to stroke his wounded ego."
3645,Does he think this impresses anyone outside his slavering and dwindling base?

3648,They're now saying she was pro-Obama (false) and the fact she was in the country while Obama was president was suspicious lol
3649,"Now the media will start fact checking the dossier, something that, to my knowledge, only Rachel Maddow has pursued, and she's found that quite a bit of it checks out. A name here and there might be misspelled, but she's connected the dots on many of the allegations.

3654,Fake news put out to distract from Rapin' Don's crime family. 
3655,"To clarify a few things that The Washington times is conveniently leaving out, Fusion GPS, who eventually subcontracted out to Steeles firm, was first hired in 2015 by republicans who didn't want Trump to win, for opposition research.

Once Trump won the primaries Democrats picked up the funding for this up until he won the nomination. At that point Democrats stopped funding this and Steele went out on his own and continued to do research.

Further, there is a difference between the idea that ""Russia"" (as a foreign state) provided (illegally-obtained) information to a campaign and the idea that ""A Ukranian official"" (as an individual) helped an American researcher legally acquire information (as far as we know). Sources for the former include all US intelligence agencies that looked into the matter, [source for the latter](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446).

2) used with a plural verb)persons of the highest class:

under the first definition I'd want my entire team to be elite, the very best group of players.

By definition number two it seems they are referring more to what we know as the one percent ers.

3788,"> There's a tendency in American progressive media to slavishly adulate whoever the latest politician was who successfully ""dunked on"" Trump, which shows that there's an enduring obsession with the kind of theatrical, surface-level politics that might excite and infatuate professional-class liberals, but don't have much relevance in the lives of most the public. ""Kamala Harris Sure Did Lay The Smackdown On Jeff Sessions!"" ""You Won't Believe How Ferociously Adam Schiff Just Owned Roger Stone."" And so on.

Yes. Completely useless platitudes. What's the point in a smackdown if the other side continues governing, and continues the current direction? It's nice to get excited, but it's pointless when the strategy of the democratic party is a perpetually losing strategy, [as evidenced by 4 for 4 special race losses - check out his TYT analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJuzOqKjLVg)

The change will not come by convincing republicans of the righteousness of your viewpoint. It certainly won't come by appealing to your own compliant base who agree with you 100%.

It will come when you adopt a platform and policies that energise the base (often at the expense of established interests and big donors who REALLY control the party), and then bring that to the electorate and energise that base, which will include independents who are sick of the corruption in Washington. Bernie did this successfully, and there's plenty of lessons of his campaign success against nearly insurmountable odds from ""the Clinton and DNC establishment"".

"
3789,"> ""Rather than cater to spurned elites' preferences - as Hillary Clinton very consciously did -Democrats would be wise to conclude that agitating against decadent elites is in fact a highly viable strategy, not just electorally but ethically.""

The electorate isn't stupid. They could see that Hillary was going to serve her donors first, and THEN get around to fighting for them. It's no wonder then why Trump was able to garner much more of the vote than was predicted.

> Whether it's him or someone else who takes up the mantle ahead of 2020, the lesson to be drawn is that a successful candidate must be animated by popular discontent with the prevailing order. And in the process, angering discredited elites—whether they be in media, Washington, or Hollywood—must not be seen as a burden to be overcome, but an advantage to be capitalized on.

Sharp point. Again, create a campaign that is populist, but be ready for a lot of pushback from the entire establishment in Washington. Let's face it, [the system is broken and doesn't produce democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE) - everyone is in on the ""game"" in Washington, and Trump was the only candidate they could vote for who was speaking this truth (even if everything else he said was a lie)."
3790,"There's great lessons in here not just for Democrats, but for progressives as well.

Sanders put the issues first.  We should always do the same."
3791,"> Sanders, as someone who once labored in precarious economic circumstances, was relatable in ways that many left-wing populist leaders around the world have historically been relatable; they rose from humble beginnings, and carry with them the anxieties of that precariousness. In other words, they're able to channel grievances due to lived experience. Given Sanders' unique relationship to the party—many voters supported him precisely because he maintained independence from the corrupted Democratic hierarchy—it's difficult to foresee who can follow in the mold.

I think the party should seriously consider changing direction and strategy, and move away from the large donors towards broad based grass roots based policies. And if they don't, the left wing should take it over. The current strategy is a losing strategy, as evidenced by [recent polling that if the election was held in April, Donald would win 40-43!!](https://youtu.be/S8-CmuagWkw?t=328)

edit:  And let's not forget that the current strategy has lost them the house, senate, whitehouse, supreme court, 66 of 99 statehouses!

b) You can do both simultaneously. You can resist Trump to protect American values, AND you can reform the DNC so it can effectively resist him and win races.

THIS is why they wouldn't back Bernie - why (just a speculation) they preferred Hillary (as bad as she was as a candidate) to Bernie. Because Bernie would change the system and they are better off in the corrupt dysfunctional system we have right now that does so much damage to the rest of the country.

Minority Outreach, imo, was a bigger factor in our defeat than the DNC's shenanigans were.  We also have a lack of experience within the political process and though we're working on transitioning and making progress, right now, we're more of a protest movement than a sustainable political movement.  We don't have good relationships with traditional liberal organizations and centers of power.  We don't have great voter registration and GOTV efforts.  We could be educating ourselves more on our issues and the arguments of our opponents so that our canvassing efforts are more successful and we don't turn off people as we often did in 2016.

I don't doubt that there are legitimate criticisms from the left of the DNC. I consider myself left of center and supported Bernie in the primaries.

However *and here we should face facts* there was a systematic disinformation campaign which played on left/center divisions *and some of it worked*.

Clinton, in her strategy to win an election, invested in getting more moderate voters out than progressive voters. Voters most enthusiastic about progressive candidates didn't vote in as large as number due to a lack of a get out the vote campaign aimed at them, as well as a general distaste for Clinton and her moderate aimed campaign. At the same time the people who Clinton wanted to vote just didn't believe in progressive candidates and weren't interested in voting for them, either splitting the ticket or abstaining from voting for a senator or representative.

A shame that you think it totally irrelevant: instead of reading carefully to understand, or in lieu of that *asking a question*, you immediately jumped onto the offensive.

Well, let me back up and *explain* what the point was: the point was that [schmucks have tried to smear Jane Sanders by lying about **xyz**]. One of the best ways to respond to such a situation is to point out that **xyz** is not [what the schmucks claim it is].

Of course we should. The Russians, and thus Trumpists, and very-often even the mainstream GOP *are primarily in the business of disinforming*.

That's not a new observation. That's not a radical observation. It's not an observation I would ever contest -- it's **TRUE**. (It also happens on the left ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman."")

No. I will not forgive it. I will not forgive it, because fair and good-faith skepticism is *never* something to be ashamed of or sorry for.

I was, however, simply point out that *you* decided that this was a ""whatabout"" thread, whereas no doubt some more-fervent leftists/bernie supporters feel like the DNC needs to get it's shit together **NOW** in preparation for the mdterms.

Hell, even if this WAS a thread started by a Russian Troll in order to shift the conversation away from Jar-Of-Mayonaise-Jr., the most effective way to *get back on track* is to [deal with the substance of the thread/OP head on], and then return to interesting discussions about Trumplestiltskin's incompetent brood.

Instead, what have you done? You've assumed and implied the bad-faith-actor status of not-only the OP, but now *me* as well: generating more heat and discussion here, instead of contributing to the topics you claim are more important.

4090,I think we need to reframe the debate like the left does.  We've actually seen this effect with the VA in the US.  Every time someone brings up healthcare reform they get called evil and wanting to kill poor people.  But how many lives will the single payer waiting game end?  Or when will the government decide youre too expensive to cure?  That just happened with Charlie Gard
4091,"Charlie Gard isn't too expensive to cure, it's that the likelihood of his suffering being prolonged is much higher than the chances of any success. Only a few people with his disease have made it to childhood or adolescence.

The child is going to die. The parents want to keep him alive as long as they can, but if they're only making the baby suffer, whose best interests is it in? Is it only so the parents can feel some brief respite in the terror they're living through?

It's not an easy situation, and it's funny how you want to arm yourself with it when you don't know a thing about it."
4092,"
Using Charlie Gard as an example against single-payer is flawed: 

1) There is no cure for his condition, even the experimental treatment is not a cure, his condition is irreversible and progressive. The child is completely ventilator dependent. His fate would be the same no matter where he lived.

2) Don't think that this wouldn't happen in the for-profit healthcare system of the United States, in this situation I wouldn't be surprised if insurers had stopped coverage for everything except for palliative care. 
Depending on his parents financial situation and coverage had he lived in the U.S he might not have lived this long. 

>Lets say you get cancer that is considered very difficult to treat. 

Difficult to treat isn't the same as incurable. 

>Or when will the government decide you're too expensive to cure. 

Again, no cure for his condition exists. 

>Every time someone brings up healthcare reform they get called evil and wanting to kill poor people. 

Because the current ""healthcare reform"" offered by the right is nothing but a tax break for the rich and a profit boost for insurance companies, paid for by gutting medicaid and consumer protections. Actual reform would be something like Medicare for all, a basic health, vision, and dental package for all citizens and permanent (legal) residents. 
"
4093,"""We determined you dont get to choose what healthcare you can have and not have""

Thats even worse.  Lets say you get cancer that is considered very difficult to treat.  Do you want the government telling you that it's rare youll live past a few more years and they dont want to ""prolong your suffering"" or fight it?  Why is this not a patient decision?"
4094,Charlie deserves every chance 
4095,"Because the patient isn't able to make decisions because the patient is a newborn.

The fact that the parents want to do the treatment is the issue, as his condition is quite literally incurable. His doctors say that it is very likely that he is suffering and in great pain. The issue becomes that the parents want to do this treatment which will only keep him alive a little longer, not cure him. The court views this as the child's suffering being prolonged out of the desperation of their parent's love.

It's not easy but you keep trying to boil it down to something it isn't. There are plenty of articles about it right now that you can read that will give you a good breakdown of the situation and it's complexity.

[Here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charlie-gard-mother-connie-yates-donald-trump-pope-offer-help-not-in-pain-terminally-ill-baby-boy-a7828601.html) is an article that gives a good rundown of why this is such a complex, emotional topic."
4096,">""We determined you dont get to choose what healthcare you can have and not have""

Except the doctors were on board, until he took a turn for the worst.  Letting people prolong a patients suffering just because they can't let them go isn't ethical either."
4097,"Eh, won't help. Dems will distance themselves from the vehemence, and the repubs will just go ""see? See? they're unhinged!"" while ignoring that their friggin President is as much."
4098,"From that article:

>A Democratic state representative in Maine threatened President Trump's life in a Facebook post Tuesday, and vowed that if he ever encountered Trump, the president would not make it through his first term in office.

>""Well then fuck you, snowflake. You're a fucking pussy ... See, it's not only Trump supporters who can talk like complete assholes,"" Rep. Scott Hamann wrote in a lengthy comment. ""As long as that's what's coming out of that side, then I'll match you dumb fucks word for word. Trump is a half term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy.""

He did not threaten the orange, p***y grabber's life like the article disingenuously claims.

The [Times article they link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) doesn't say that, nor does it include the e-mails. It doesn't even mention e-mails, and neither did the first story, it's all ""according to sources"".

Don Jr. didn't release the e-mails until the 11th, 2 days after the *second* story on the subject in the NYT.

This is true

>George Soros tried to pay off Trump but Trump wouldn't take a bribe (he was bribed billions, but Trump insisted on exposing the truth). The media is Soros-funded propaganda, and Trump was able to get people to reject what they read in the mainstream media. People turned to unbiased sources like breitbart and infowars, which educated them about how the government lies sometimes, and to use critical thinking rather than just trust government. Getting people to not trust the Soros-funded media made it harder for Soros to control the election. The election was still rigged against Trump, but he was such a strong candidate that he overcame millions of illegal immigrants payed off by Soros to vote democrat.

* The Republican party controls the Congress so they don't need Dems to approve anyone.

The issue is that high quality traditional journalism will use a milquetoast headline like ""Email woes deepen for Donald Trump Jr,"" and then they'll put the actual lede in the first paragraph. They do this because they want to be able to provide context in full sentences instead of click-baity headlines.

But lower quality online-focused news sites will make the lede, ""Donald Trump Jr releases emails that show clear acknowledgement that Russian lawyer intended to deliver anti-Clinton information sourced from the Russian government,"" the title and that will inevitably get more upvotes on Reddit even if it contains no real sources itself and just links to a NY Times article.

4836,"I never denied this claim, I acknowledged that they may have some similar distant relatives but to say this claim is to conclude for the similar views in culture is just borderline false. Once you realize the major distinctions between the Jewish world(Israel) and the Islamic world(Saudi Arabia, iraq, iran, etc) you will then start to understand the israel-palestine issue to be more than a territorial dispute but rather opposing worldviews that one side clearly must win if you believe in equality. Semitism and Semitic are two different words and two different meanings. "
4837,"Absolutely not, we can subjectively say that Jewish culture and society is not merely more prosperous but that anti-Semitism is deeply troubling in Muslim majority countries. Albeit I come from an entirely different geological area from the Jews, I can say that my worldview regarding human philosophy and human dignity is closer to the Jews than the Arabs are to the Jews. Sure they may have some closer distant relatives, but to claim there the ""same people in many ways"" is delusional. "
4838,"This was in response to the Vox video, in which they argue that Palestine should have custody of the land because they were there longer than the Jews. This is the only defense of Palestine most westerns give albeit as I just pointed out its fairly weak one. My position of Israel holding onto the land and not conceding any land is fairly simple, Israel has proven not only thru law but practically that they are committed to the rights we in the West cherish(equality under law, protection for homosexuals, respect for privacy, freedom of religion, etc) and the rights that so many Muslim majority countries violate on a day to day basis. Therefore it's only rational not only thru Hamas's rhetoric but by historical precedent of Muslim governments in the area that had Palestine held onto the land it would be a theocratic hellhole similar to Iran or Iraq. "
4839,"i never said you denied anything and i never said they have the same culture or views, i actually agreed with you while making another very valid and factual point. and i honestly could care less about your opinions on how related Jews & Arabs are or aren't, i'm only concerned with facts."

4930,"I'm not Canadian so I don't care so much, in any event people can change the laws if they don't like it."
4931,"Especially cause most Canadians would lose it if you walk around in their house with your shoes on... 

I bet it was his slushy boots too. 

"
4932,These mooslims are oot and aboot! We cannot have that here friend!
4933,"I've been switching back and forth from MSNBC, CNN and Fox and Fox is covering it as little as possible. Wonder why?  Meanwhile, the other two networks are doing in depth analysis with legal experts and investigative journalists."
4934,Payment must be made through a valid WoW account.
4935,I came to say the same.  That's not so bad.  One daily will probably get you at least 3 times that.
4936,"There's not, really. Some dude is giving a sob story about how unfair the world is. I'm fairly certain there's a lot more to it than that considering that Fox seems to have gone out of their way to *not* include any other side of it than that. You'd expect them to at least try to get statements from the court and the tenants, but they don't even say that they did."
4937,True. I'm a Canadian living in the US and I find it weird that it's normal to walk around your house with shoes on here. 
4938,"http://www.torontosun.com/2017/04/26/human-rights-tribunal-rules-brampton-landlord-must-pay-muslim-couple-12000

They have him on video requesting that he remove his shoes while visiting their bedroom and him refusing, after he had been asked time and time again before. He (the landlord) also refused to be quiet after 10pm and shoveled snow in such a manner that it banged against their apartment walls and windows. Abusive and disrespectful.

It's some moronic asshole abusing their power repeatedly and then pretending to be the victim when he gets called out and punished for it. The epitomic republican snowflake."
4939,"I'm not your friend, buddy!"
4940,"So I found another story from a local source.  Basically the landlord was somewhat racist towards the family and showed a history of anti-muslim bias (he posted an anti-muslim joke on FB).  It wasn't just the shoes, it was the lack of notice when showing the apartment, and some text messages that were deemed threatening."
4941,I don't think it is.
4942,"So basically if they weren't Muslim and they asked him to remove his shoes this probably wouldn't even be a headline then, right Fox News?"
4943,"I mean. I don't know that I would call wearing your boots and shoveling snow noisily some kind of abuse of power... The guy is kind of a dick, but don't be so melodramatic."
4944,"Well I'm not your buddy, pal!"
4945,Color me surprised.
4946,"Yeah, not saying it's good or bad - just confirming that I think it's a cultural difference. "
4947,"Yeah I mean to the parent commenter's point, walking around in someone's bedroom in boots during a canadian winter is a dick thing to do. To do it repeatedly and get caught doing so on camera while the tenants are asking you to stop is just harrasment."
4948,"How is it not? If your landlord is a dick, repeatedly, in spite of your repeated requests for him to stop being a dick, is it really such a shame that the tenants had some recourse? At some point, punishment should be warranted if he refuses to be civil."
4949,"Won't you please,  won't you please, please won't you be my neighbor?"
4950,"I don't understand the purpose of wearing shoes indoors, it's not like you need it for protection or because it's cold, it just drags the dirt (or worse) from outside in."
4951,"I grew up in a fairly middle/upper class area in the States and it was always ""shoes off"". Who knows."
4952,"Punishment doesn't fit the offense at all. I seriously doubt that him wearing his shoes and giving them 24-hours notice when he was showing the place, but not an additional 5 minute heads up was causing them so much stress... Seems like the Canadian equivalent of a frivolous lawsuit."
4953,Do you play hockey?
4954,"Eh while I see the point I disagree. Yes I would say that fining someone for walking around in dirty boots in your hours is over-the-top. But if they keep doing it and refuse to comply when asked to stop, especially if it's your landlord who can barge in any time he wants and doesn't want to give some additional courtesy heads up, I think it's well-deserved. It shows that this person has no respect for your space and intends to make your life hell for as long as he can."
4955,"I have 4 hockey sticks and one goalie stick.   It's been a while since I skated, but street hockey, sure.  Go Habs!"
4956,"Street hockey? Like withoot ice? 

I don't know...do you speak French at least?"
4957,"Un peu, mon pere est ne a Trois Riveres, mais ma mere etait Irlandaise du Massachusetts.   Et vous?"
4958,Shitty french? Well I guess you satisfy one of the two use cases for being Canadian. Come on over pal.
4959,My crime is not illegal because look at that guy
4960,*The Buck Stops Way The Fuck Over There...*
4961,This whole thing will go down as textbook example of how not to handle a scandal.  Everything they do further inflames it
4962,Just a word of advice to conservatives. Please don't defend this. Please have at least a degree of shame and dignity and recognize a dead horse when you see one. I really want to have faith in humanity again. Don't defend this treason.
4963,">The FBI has uncovered no evidence of collusion after a yearlong investigation

Well that's a flat out lie. Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone must not exist in Moonie world. "
4964,History will not be kind to these spineless hacks. 
4965,"Look over there while I run away!!

This is legitimately the funniest thing ever."
4966,"""Yeah, that's just a couple emails... BUT HER EMAILS!"""
4967,"Today has been a big day for Hillary Clinton. You literally can not find a defense by a Trumper that doesn't invoke her in some way. Pretty amazing how influential she is, even after losing the election."
4968,"To which they say, ""nah fam your son just confirmed you were actively engaging with Russia."" Seriously why would trump even give two shits about Bernie, he's been using sanders as this puppet against the Democratic Party and sanders himself has no grudge and knows he wants to fix the party rather than divide it."
4969,That's pretty desperate.
4970,"The Trump administration is completely and utterly fucked. Their downfall ushers in a new era of laws tailored to curb the power of the presidency and to remove dark money from politics.

That's the optimistic side of me, the pessimistic side says his army of rubes will start rioting and burning shit"
4971,"Did any DNC ops actually go to the Ukrainian embassy like they are saying? If so, were they actually connected to the Clinton campaign? Or just general DNC ops?

I feel like this whole DNC/Ukraine thing is (if true) a separate issue. One that *should* be discussed. But that issue shouldn't downplay this issue here with Trump Jr."
4972,The DNC is clean as a whistle. Trump is fucking delusional.
4973,Moon-bat times. Have a down vote.
4974,"So. Many. Shitposts. Today.

Must be on forced overtime in Macedonia."
4975,"What crime? There has been no evidence of any illegal activity. 

Edit: if there is evidence please provide some. Not just speculation."
4976,"We do the fucking, but the buck stops with them."
4977,To imagine I thought Hillary was bad at handling scandals lol!
4978,"They'll just pretend it's nothing.

Same as neolibs with every Hillary scandal including Benghazi and the private server.

Minimize, mock, deflect, dodge.

Truth died the day Hillary became nominee. After that all we had was the sociopath liar and the psychopath liar..

Protip: next time pick the sociopath, k?"
4979,"And as it turns out, they didn't need to bother. DJT Jr is happy to just release it for everyone!"
4980,"What is it with their obsession of strict time limits in the process?

""The clock is ticking"".... ""a yearlong investigation""...

Prominent members of the highest office in the land are STILL being investigated as new info continues to be released, but they're treating it like a gd game show.

4983,Lol. I dont like Trump but thats a bald faced lie. The DNC is not clean as a whistle.

5022,Desperation has a stench. A stench like spray tan and unwashed scrotum.
5023,If by 'America' you mean 'Russia' then yes.
5024,"Trump refuses to hold Russia accountable for the massive insult they made to the integrity of our democratic elections.

Whether he's refusing because he's complicit, or because he admires Russia, or because he just doesn't want to undermine his own mandate, it's irrelevant. He's not taking America's side in any way, shape, or form."
5025,"Yeahhhhh conservatives can oppose anything nowadays as long as it ""pisses off liberal snowflakes"". Its pretty pathetic that they focus more on slandering people than trying to run the country.  "
5026,"> ...and now we have a President who won’t lie either.

Yeah, okay. And for reference, that was more or less the most rational thing the article had to say.

5028,"A girl can dream can't she?

I always like to think there's still one open minded person left on this sub who can be reached. "
5029,"You're not going to convince actually open-minded people with this kind of dialogue. Here are some experts:

""The West is superior to the rest of the world in every significant way... But if you're a progressive, you're gonna have a little sissy snit fit like so many libs did in the wake of the President’s triumphant Warsaw speech.""

How do you plan on reaching people you disagree with when your article immediately accuses them of ""little sissy snit fits?""

""Yet the left still insists that we stop believing our lying eyes and start believing the liberal Fifth Column of multicultural liars infesting America’s alleged elite.""

Once again, attacking people isn't a great way to reach out to them.

""Except our eyes aren’t lying, and now we have a President who won’t lie either.""

Would you like me to outline, in great detail, the lies our President has told? Actual lies? This statement is patently false. The President lies through his [teeth](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html) daily.

The rest of the short piece from your link (not even an article, I might add) goes into American exceptionalism and some strange comments about Russian involvement with Obama and Clinton (which, even if they did exist, could not even come close to the emails Donald Trump Jr. published today, of his own accord).

You're not going to reach ""open-minded"" people with this kind of article because this kind of article isn't meant for open-minded people. It's insulting, a distillation of the pro-Trump echo chamber, and just objectively false.

Please try harder."
5030,This is exactly why the Democrat party keeps losing election after election-you're out of touch with the American people.
5031,"I never though I'd be arguing on a removed post, but here we are. The actual last thing I'm going to say is wow - I can't believe you managed to come up with that as a reply. So far away from any semblance of a response to anything I said, a nice pivot to a line of reasoning I can't refute because of how subjective a claim it is, I'm actually pretty impressed. Please don't hurt yourself with all your mental gymnastics. Goodbye."
5032,"I am looking forward to a large stable of democratic candidates running in 2020 and I'd bet a fair amount that Booker is one of them. He isn't my top choice, that would be a man who looks suspiciously like Barack Obama with a mustache named [Guy Incognito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jaAeTaG_ms), but I would sure vote for him in the general."

5036,No.
5037,"Yes he can run - hopefully the democrats will have a fair primary process by that time. 

But good luck trying to win the progressive wing. The progressive wing isn't interested in establishment candidates, pretend progressives, or ANY candidate who wants to benefit from money in politics, rather than change the system.

5039,"The same Cory Booker who defended Kushner when it was found out he had an undisclosed meeting with the Russians? Yeah not getting my vote, supporting treasonous bastards makes you a traitor as well."

5042,[deleted]
5043,"Oh yes. :)

Dont you find him to be a charismatic orator?"
5044,I like him.
5045,the bernie wing is completely unreasonable
5046,"There isn't anyone at this point who hasn't pissed off the Bernie wing, that's electable."
5047,"Unless they have staggering charisma, I don't think its a good idea to run anyone who is in the pocket of Wall Street or Big Pharma.

Its not booker's fault because I get his constituents are largely employed by big pharma, but it is what it is. "
5048,"Bernie today just said not to jump to judgement with Don Jr  

https://twitter.com/sppeoples/status/884818504590950401"
5049,Why is Reddit hating on Cory Booker? Is it just that pharmaceutical vote?
5050,Trump too was a charismatic orator. I'd rather have someone with good policy ideas instead.
5051,"Warren, Schumer, O'Malley, Gillibrand, Biden (if he isn't too old), Murphy, Cuomo, and **Franken** are all totally viable options that most of the Berniecrats are generally OK with.

Warren might be a bit too old at that point, but she does have charisma and not too much baggage. She is a little far out on the left for many, which may disqualify her, but hey, if Trump won from where he was on the political and moral spectrum...anyone can.

Schumer has perhaps too much baggage and a bit too much beltway experience to be seen as viable, but he's a reasonable choice. High profile, long-term leader in the party and government, charismatic but measured, and liberal but not so much as to turn people off. Has integrity.

O'Malley ran last time, and while he made little headway, he is a good leader, fairly young, quite charismatic, liberal, viable, etc.

Gillibrand would be a pretty fantastic way to unite the party, and is  viable female choice (i.e, non-Clinton, non-Warren)

Biden is beloved. A fantastic pick, if he's not too old. Even a lot of conservatives like him, and not because he's their bitch on a bunch of issues. He's just a stand-up guy.

Murphy is inexperienced, but still a good pick.

Cuomo could work

Franken would be fantastic. Liberal, strong record, funny, and a former entertainer who can go toe-to-toe with Trump. Unlike Trump, however, he's smart like a whip and sticks to his convictions. Good firebrand to pull in the left, good policies and decorum to pull in the center, good entertainment to pull in the non-voters. My favorite for 2020."
5052,It's honestly just ridiculous how unreasonable that particular wing of the party gets. If any Democratic politician dares make one wrong vote or statement they disagree with on *anything* that politician is shitlisted as the fucking devil. 
5053,Warren is borderline with the Bernie wing. It would be easy for her to repair that bridge if need be.
5054,"Liz is your only reasonable hope. The people to the left of her who say they won't vote for her will come around. 

Then again, Bernie is running again in 2020. So most of them will be alright. Also, they're going to age 4 years. People change. "
5055,I don't know that we're going to see anything comparable to Obama charisma again in our lives.
5056,Booker is pretty charismatic. 
5057,"Bernie Sanders tells me re: Don Jr emails: “These are very, very, very serious allegations"" but “there should not be a rush to judgment""

Kinda gotta see the context here."
5058,That's Bernie. He doesn't rush to judge anything.
5059,"Personally, he's always come across as a sleazeball. Every interview I've seen him do, he's been a consummate politician, weighing and calculating every single minute little thing for maximum possible votes gotten. I know some people like a bit of flip-flopping and deal making in their candidates, but I do not.

It's a little sickening to me. I like my politicians to have some spine and fire in their bellies, rather than weak-willed fence sitters who change opinions at the drop of a dime. And that description seems to fit Booker to a T.

Plus, he's just not all that viable a candidate. Most on the far-left hate him for being a pseudo-conservative, and those on the conservative side would rather just vote for a real conservative rather than a pseudo-conservative. So Booker wins the center and center-left, but that's not enough to win the election, when the super-liberals stay home and the conservative rally behind Trump.

That's basically what happened in 2016, and if Booker runs in the general, I'm pretty confident that's also what will happen in 2020."
5060,"And what he did with Newark Public Schools. To me, the pharma vote was just a layer of icing and confirmation."
5061,"He's at the forefront of the potential 2020 candidates, so Sanders supporters are trying to swiftboat him early. They're doing the same with Gilibrand, Harris, and Warren."
5062,"Not just the pharmaceutical vote, or the BS reasons he provided for voting with republicans against it, but also..

He has a record of cozying up to Wall Street donors, defending corporations like Bain Capital, and supporting Michelle Rhee's extreme school-privatization agenda.

Booker also declined to endorse his party's call for the White House to revoke Kushner's security clearance after reports that he sought to set up back-channel communications with Russian officials. Why? Well...Jared Kushner donated more than $41,000 to Booker's Senate campaign in 2013. Also, Ivanka Trump hosted a fundraiser for Booker during that election.

[Cory Booker And Jared Kushner: Democrat Received Campaign Cash From Trump's Son-In-Law](http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/cory-booker-jared-kushner-democrat-received-campaign-cash-trumps-son-law-2545035)

Thus, whether its Wall st., Big Pharma, Kushner, etc...Booker has been viewed (even by Dems) as a sell-out. 

It's only recently that he has started aligning his positions with his constituents and progressive organizations. Could it be because he plans to run in 2020 and needs votes/endorsements? Most definitely. "
5063,"His interview on Pod Save America was fantastic though.

The Pharma vote is nothing. People made way too much of that. I think the real problem is his views on education. "
5064,[deleted]
5065,They're going to age 4 years... and so will the folks who were 14 years old in 2016.
5066,Eh. They said that after Bill Clinton.
5067,"He's not bad, but sometimes he'll pivot or strategically answer a question that reminds me of Clinton. Like he's a little too composed.  

Its not that I think he's uncharismatic, but that I don't think he's quite charismatic enough to handwave the ties he has to big pharma. "
5068,`Bout as charismatic as my left nut.
5069,exactly. cool as a cucumber
5070,Just not interested in politicians that favor corporations over the general population or bend to corporate lobbying.  I don't think that has any similarity to John Kerry's 2004 presidential run.
5071,Yup. They're going to have a different perspective than 2016 too. Hopefully we can move the fuck on and do something about these lobbyists and party contractors.
5072,Maybe we *will* have President Dwayne Johnson.
5073,"Kander could get there, maybe not 2020 but I think he's got a bright future. "
5074,People act like being a canny politician is a bad thing. Politics is very much acting a lot of the times. You'll never fine anyone completely sincere. 
5075,I don't think you've heard him speak nearly enough then. 
5076,"You basically just proved his point, lol. "
5077,"Possibly. But ""different"" could mean further right *or* left."
5078,"I find people more sincere than Booker, that's the issue for me. 

I mean don't get me wrong, if Booker is on the ticket he's got my vote, he's just not my preferred candidate. "
5079,"People like sincerity in their candidates. You don't have to be 100% sincere, but being a known flip-flopper is a bad thing--with good reason. How can your voters know you're actually going to do what you say you will in office when you're known to lie through your teeth on most every issue?

Especially against Trump, who for some reason exudes sincerity to a lot of people despite most of what he promised being demonstrably undoable, running a ""consummate politician"" is not a good idea."
5080,The swift boat attacks had nothing to do with John Kerry's political agenda. His voting record has everything to do with his agenda. Unless I am missing something not the point that was made. 
5081,"If a presidential candidate can't summon the nerve to critique capitalism, the financial industry and the political behavior of most billionaires, and fairly harshly, then they're just not going to interest the democratic socialist wing. I don't think there's anything remotely wrong with that, until after the nominee to face Trump is officially ordained of course."
5082,They're not going to go right. Even if Dwayne Johnson runs.

Also, personally, I don't care if it was a democrat, republican, or whatever party did this or if I had a strong affiliation with them - having foreign parties (with government ties) meddling is such a shitty thing.

5095,"Well, China definitely had a place in that conversation until Russia really threw their weight into influencing the 2016 election. China has been expanding their influence (through trade and investment) in Latin America. That makes it easier for Chinese businesses, including state owned enterprises, to compete with American businesses and undermine our economy. Russia in 2012 was mostly a threat to our European allies, China was a greater threat to American economic interests at the time. Russia didn't take over as the greater threat to America itself until they went after our system of government."

He also ignores the fact that Trumplet knew he was meeting with an agent of a foreign government to receive illegally obtained information (unless you're arguing that Russia somehow obtained 30k emails from a private server legally), which doubles down on the criminal conspiracy.

>Even if Trump campaign officials had happily accepted damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Russians -- and there is no evidence that they did -- so far there has been nothing to prove that they engaged in illegal activity through their interest in obtaining the material.

5183,"No, he's pointing out that you're not evenly applying your own definition of ""things of value,"" so you're argument is unlikely to hold up in court. However, the prosecutor likely understands the law better than you so won't try making this argument anyway"

It's a different subject in a different situation, and honestly bears only the slightest legal parallels.

For someone shocked about lack of detail, you're surprisingly blasé about the lack of any relevant detail in the article.

I stand by my previous post, you're defending something in an incomprehensible way and deflecting criticism of the defence.

I disagree. I also don't think he even looked into the legality of it. He released it within an hour of being informed about it. Releasing it was 100% a PR move to get ahead of the media and pretend like they did it voluntarily. If they truly believed it was 100% legal then he would have disclosed it and not lied about it for the past year."

Why would you wonder this?  Wikileaks released exclusively pro-Trump, anti-Clinton ""leaks"" for the last 18 months.  They're as thick as thieves.

The better question is, why did Russia want Trump to win?  What about Clinton winning terrified them so much?"

5248,Selling us out to the Russians is not treason?  Ok then.
5249,"Literally the only reason it is not treason is because the constitution says that we must be *formally* at war with an enemy nation for someone to commit treason in aiding said nation. 

But when congress is controlled by Republicans, a number of whom may be Russian plants or on Russian payroll, and the Republican president is *a Russian plant*, you can see how it would be difficult, maybe impossible, to *be* formally declared for war with Russia. 

*Legally*, can he be *charged* with treason?  No.  But this vox piece acts as though it is absurd that we call it treason. 

Russia attacked us.  They've committed unprecedented attacks on our democracy and to this day are conducting widespread penetration attacks on our nuclear and defense networks. 

What these people did is treason.  Yes, they will be shielded by fellow traitors in congress and by the treasonous President who is pushing to give Russia *greater* access to our systems, but that doesn't mean this *isn't treason*. 

This is treason.  Call it treason.  Let Mueller and the prosecutors work out what crimes among the myriad of criminal actions these people have committed they can actually use to strip them of their power and their office.

5317,"For those interested, the **F-35 Lightning II** is a series of single seat stealth multirole fighters developed by Lockheed Martin, first put in service in 2015. While it holds an ""F"" designation indicating air combat capability, it is also considered a ground attack aircraft. 

Designed in the same vein as its beefier older brother, the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 holds many of the same traits. It is the first operational supersonic SVTOL stealth aircraft, meaning it can initiate a vertical or horizontal takeoff, reach supersonic speeds, all while maintaining a reduced detectability. It is intended to hold a low Radar Cross Section (RCS), a measure of how detectable an object is on radar. This is accomplished through a number of techniques, first among them being radar-absorbent materials. Certain materials like fiber-mat, can intake radar waves, rather than bouncing them back at the sender, thereby reducing the likelihood that the F-35 would be spotted. The shape of the aircraft is also deliberate, ensuring very little of the aircraft offers surfaces that would reflect radar waves back to the source. The small bumps just forward of the engine air intakes form part of the diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) which is a simpler, lighter means to ensure high-quality airflow to the engine over a wide range of conditions. These inlets also crucially improve the aircraft's very-low-observable characteristics (by eliminating radar reflections between the diverter and the aircraft's skin). Additionally, the ""bump"" surface reduces the engine's exposure to radar, significantly reducing a strong source of radar reflection because they provide an additional shielding of engine fans against radar waves. Like other stealth fighters, however, the F-35 is more susceptible to detection by low-frequency radars because of the Rayleigh scattering resulting from the aircraft's physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Although fighter-sized stealth aircraft could be detected by low-frequency radar, missile lock and targeting sensors primarily operate in the X-band, which F-35 RCS reduction is made for, so they cannot engage unless at close range.

One drawback of the F-35 is its acoustic presence. It is twice as loud at takeoff as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and up to four times as loud during landing. A USAF environmental impact study found that replacing F-16s with F-35s at Tucson International Airport would subject more than 21 times as many residents to extreme noise levels. The USN will need to redesign hearing protection for sailors to protect against the ""thundering 152 decibels"" of the F-35.

The F-35 features a full-panel-width glass cockpit touchscreen ""panoramic cockpit display"" (PCD). A cockpit speech-recognition system (DVI) provided by Adacel has been adopted on the F-35 and the aircraft will be the first operational U.S. fixed-wing aircraft to employ this DVI system, although similar systems have been used on the similarly VTOL AV-8B Harrier II and trialed in previous aircraft, such as the F-16 VISTA. A helmet-mounted display system (HMDS) will be fitted to all models of the F-35. While some fighters have offered HMDS along with a head up display (HUD), this will be the first time in several decades that a front line fighter has been designed without a HUD. The F-35 employs an oxygen system derived from the F-22's own system, which has been involved in multiple hypoxia incidents on that aircraft; unlike the F-22, the flight profile of the F-35 is similar to other fighters that routinely use such systems. On June 9, 2017 the 55 F-35s at Luke Air Force Base were grounded after five pilots complained of hypoxia-like symptoms over a five-week span. Symptoms ranged from dizziness to tingling in their extremities. The suspension was initially expected to last one day, but was extended to give investigators more time. Flying was resumed on 20 June, with no direct cause having been found.

The F-35's conceptual maintenance program is for any one of them to be maintained in any F-35 maintenance facility and that all F-35 parts in all bases will be globally tracked and shared as needed. The commonality between the different variants has allowed the USMC to better organize maintenance training programs. The aircraft has been designed for ease of maintenance, with 95% of all field replaceable parts ""one deep"" where nothing else has to be removed to get to the part in question. For instance the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy, the use of low-maintenance electro-hydrostatic actuators instead of hydraulic systems and an all-composite skin without the fragile coatings found on earlier stealth aircraft.

The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) has stated that the aircraft has received good reviews from pilots and maintainers, suggesting it is performing better than its predecessors did at a similar stage of development, and that the stealth type has proved relatively stable from a maintenance standpoint. However, the DOT&E Report on the F-35 program published in January 2015 determined that the plane has not, in fact, reached any of the nine reliability measures the program was supposed to achieve by this point in its development and that the JPO has been re-categorizing failure incidents to make the plane look more reliable than it actually is. Further, the complexity of maintaining the F-35 means that, currently, none of the Services are ready to keep it in working order and instead ""rely heavily on contractor support and unacceptable workarounds."" DOT&E found that the program achieved 61 percent of planned flight hours and that the average rate of availability was as low as 28 percent for the F-35A and 33 percent for the F-35B. According to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management, in FY2014, each non-test F-35 flew only 7.7 hours per month, which amounts to approximately one sortie every 5.5 days—for combat purposes, a sortie rate so low as to be crippling. Mean flight hours between removal (MFHBR) have increased, but are still only 59 percent to 65 percent of the required threshold. DOT&E found that mean corrective maintenance time for critical failures got worse for the F-35A and the F-35C over the last year. Structural cracking is also proving to be a recurring and enduring problem that is not yet resolved. The plane was designed with the intent of replacing the long running A-10 as the leading Close Air Support aircraft , earning controversy among branches of the U.S. Armed Forces accustomed to the support provided by the A-10. These branches, chiefly the Army and Marines, claim its anti-tank capability and low speed allow it to cruise the battlefield with devastating accuracy and firepower, a trait they find the F-35 lacks.

The F-35 Lightning II can fly slightly faster than Mach 1.6+(1,200 mph, 1,930 km/h) and as farther than 1,200 nmi (2,220 km) on internal fuel. It comes standard with a 25mm GAU-22/A 4-barrel rotary cannon internally mounted with 180 rounds. It has 6 external hardpoints under the wings for munitions, but these are not often used, as they compromise the stealth capability of the aircraft. The 2 internal weapon bays are preferred, as these can open upon lock, and close upon dumping their payload, thereby maintaining a low Radar Cross Section. It can carry any number of munitions, including air-to-air missiles like the AIM-9 Sidewinder or Air-to-Ground missiles like the AGM-88 AARGM. It is also nuclear-capable, possessing the ability to carry a B61 ""dial a yield"" thermonuclear bomb. The F-35 Lightning II is operated by such groups as the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Danish Air Force, the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom, and, of course, the United States Marine Corps and Navy."

And much like enemies, the term hostilities also has a very specific definition in U.S. law. According to 10 U.S. Code § 948a, hostitilities mean ""any conflict subject to the laws of war."" Peace time relations are not subject to the laws of war. Only actual wars and armed conflicts are."

Frankly aside from a few niches, on the surface the Republican Party and Jesus don't seem like they would be friends. Don't get me wrong he wouldn't have been friends with the Democratic Party either, he wasn't about Political Ideologies. He just cared about the people, and about helping them. The way I see it is that in the Bible Jesus just sort of went where he was needed. He would hang out with prostitutes, the sick, the downtrodden, and the criminals.

The problem is when the need for national secrets runs up against an administration that is secretly destroying the country. How do you balance that? If you leak, you are hurting the country in a way, by leaking secrets. If you don't leak, then you're letting an administration use secrecy to to destroy the country and get away with it.

> He said that progressives believe that rights come from the government, while the Declaration describes how they are inalienable grants to humanity from God.


Rights do not come from god, and rights are not inalienable. Every right you have is man made. There are no innate human rights in nature.

> We hold these truths to be self-evident

This right here is no different than saying ""because we want them."" 

A more detailed argument:

http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/kylecupp/2012/08/the-trouble-with-self-evident-human-rights-an-example/

> The Declaration of Independence begins with a bit of bad philosophy: to wit, positing, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.”  These supposedly self-evident human rights do not really exist for reasons I touched on the other day.  They are neither self-evident (known non-inferentially or as analytically true) nor accessible through intuition.  There’s no way to demonstrate their existence–or that they are endowed by God, who also eludes demonstration.  In practice, these “rights” are grounded in nothing more than the say-so of whoever has the power to have them recognized in culture and in law.  They fail at the start at their raison d’être–establishing a firm basis for an objective morality.

> Take, for example, the culture war debate over the ethics of abortion.  On the one hand, you have the asserted right to life on the part of the fetus; on the other hand, you have the posited right to choose abortion on the part of the woman.  Both sides in this debate operate 1) under the notion that the Constitution, in truth, recognizes their alleged right, but also, and more importantly, 2) under the principle that the law ought to recognize and secure their own posited right (and not the other).  Within the framework of self-evident human rights, however, there’s no basis for choosing one right over the other.  Both the pro-life side and the pro-choice side will appeal to more than “self-evident rights,” of course–e.g., the sanctity of human life and the autonomy of the individual, respectively–but of course they have to go beyond this rights language to have any kind of objective grounding.  To stay within this field of rights is to play an endless game of power."

5757,"I'm a progressive Social Democrat; I'm pro-immigrant ideologically, but I do not support the current Democratic consensus that is ambiguous with how they want to reform our naturalization laws and is mostly tolerant or apathetic to undocumented immigrants while not doing enough to make sure that proper labor laws and reforms are in place first. I believe it hurts the working class, who has very little protection or safety net comparatively for a class within a developed nation, that does little in benefit for the Middle-class, and while mostly benefits the Capitalistic classes. Here's where I disagree with the article:

Quote from the article: 

>He focuses on a narrow academic debate over whether or not immigration modestly reduces wages for certain native-born high school dropouts — who are less than 8 percent of the total native-born population, and an even smaller portion of the working-age population — and not on the overwhelming academic consensus that the other 92.4 percent are held harmless or benefit from immigration, and that Americans gain overall.

The debate isn't really narrow as far as how much as been published by various differing authors as an economical topic, or how much attention it receives publicly. 'Modestly reduce' is deceitful, as how much little low-skilled Citizens have, and he is citing annual reduction rates in income--which although are in the single-digits, you do have to consider that those are annual percentage reductions that add up over the years for our less-prosperous group of people (and often the most disadvantaged). [And it isn't just 'high-school drop-outs', but the more 'low-skilled' in general](https://gborjas.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/nas-large-table-5-1.png) who don't see benefits, but in most hypothetical scenarios, see a reduction or meager increases in income, which is meaningless to the increase of productivity they generate or for the increase costs of living over time. 

The next thing which rustled my jimmies that I found offending that Vox deemed appropriate was post in the manner they did was two economic leading academic surveys  for each word under ""overwhelming academic"", with one being for [high-skilled](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/high-skilled-immigrants), and another being for [low-skilled](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants). If you haven't / unable to click the links, let me just summarize the differences for you right now: the leading economic academics/experts vastly and practically agree uncontested with the question of if 'High-skilled immigration helps the average American' (which I definitely do agree) but the consensus of the results of said survey is comparatively much more different than the survey about 'would an increase of unskilled immigrants help the average American': whose results are 50% agree, 28% are uncertain, and 9% disagree, and has a follow-up question of ""*Unless they were compensated by others, many low-skilled American workers would be substantially worse off if a larger number of low-skilled foreign workers were legally allowed to enter the US each year.*"" with the results of those surveyed being: 4% strongly agreed, 46% agreed, 30% uncertain, 7% disagree, and 2% strongly disagreed. The 'low-skilled' part I want to emphasize. Only 40% of Americans have an Associates degree or higher, which I suspect a lot of skilled workers with certifications click on the 'Associates' part, but lets say that there's another 10% of the working population that has a skilled certification or a field that requires formal training, and those in it click on the 'High school degree' for their highest education attainment, that still leaves 50% of the population being classified as 'low-skilled', and there being a more agreed-inclined consensus by Economists that they would be hurt by increases in the supply low-skilled immigrant workers in the labor force. You can also look under the 'comment' in the results table in the 'low-skilled immigrants' survey and you'll see that there's many of those who answer 'agree' or 'uncertain' raise more questions about the survey's presented question or include their own extra criteria of what 'average' means to defend their stance.

Quote 

>Beinart portrays a National Academy of Sciences study on immigration as showing major costs to native workers, when the study actually concluded, “the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small”; when the study came out, the New York Times’ Thomas Edsall correctly summarized, “the academy comes down decisively on the pro-immigration side of the debate.”

The study states the following:

""*When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the overall native wage may be small and close to zero. However, estimates for subgroups span a wider range and suggest some revisions in understanding of the wage impact of immigration since the 1990s…The intensive research on this topic over the past two decades, summarized in Table 5-2, displays a much wider variation in the estimates of the wage impact on natives who are most likely to compete with immigrants, with some studies suggesting sizable negative wage effects on native high school dropouts…Thus, the evidence suggests that groups comparable to the immigrants in terms of their skill may experience a wage reduction as a result of immigration-induced increases in labor supply, although there are still a number of studies that suggest small to zero effects.*""

The zero average wage effect in the long run (“10 years or more”) [is based on the structural estimates reported in Table 5-1](https://gborjas.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/nas-large-table-5-1.png). Take a look at the last column of that table and note that the long-run impact of immigration on the average wage of workers is always exactly equal to 0.0 percent, regardless of which scenario we look at. 

As the panel itself acknowledges, however, this zero wage effect is built in by the mathematics of the model: “*In the case of structural studies, when capital is assumed to be perfectly flexible, [average] wage effects on natives are zero, although this result is built in by theoretical assumptions.*” Put bluntly, claims that the long-run effect of immigration on the average wage is “*small and close to zero*” have nothing to do with the data. That result is instead a by-product of a mathematical assumption used to construct the model of the labor market.

And, to make matters worse, this mathematical assumption cascades over to every other number reported in Table 5-1. After all, the wage effects for the various skill groups must average out to zero. This means that each particular wage impact needs to “*align itself*” around zero so that the weighted average of the relevant numbers indeed adds up to the mathematically built-in 0.0 long run wage effect. 

The conclusion of the 2016 NAS on this topic, is in effect, bunk. They skewed the criteria for the conclusion they wanted to say.

>Calling for enforcement that punishes companies that hire undocumented immigrants, rather than the immigrants themselves, is a cruel sleight of hand. If you’re an undocumented immigrant working in a good job — maybe as a domestic care worker in a welcoming household, or for a compassionate boss at a restaurant — and your job gets taken away due to the enforcement of this provision, are you really being held harmless? Or is the government denying you your livelihood in service of upholding a manifestly unjust law?

The Dems should focus on punishing companies that hire undocumented immigrants, for not only do a lot of them avoid many labor laws and safety regulations as why some of them hire them for, but if they're paying them under-the-table, they probably also and have committed many other related offenses to, or similar to, that--enough so to be on some law enforcement agency's radar and worth going after by some Prosecutors. If increases of low-skilled immigration does hurt low-skilled workers, as some leading economists cited in the survey Vox used agree, then why should we tolerate businesses that exploit undocumented immigrants to undercut labor costs and bargaining, especially when the US is suffering already from great inequality and lack of mandated labor protections and benefits as a Western developed nation?

I'd rather we have controlled, legal immigration so that people are liberal enough to want to spend money on foreign aid and make mutually beneficial trade deals with developing countries, than have massive migrations that get people like Trump elected, and the ""close the borders cut off all foreign aid"" mindset becomes the majority among white people. I'm just being pragmatic, it's extremely unlikely we'll have a truly progressive society when governments ignore public opinion with regards to immigration and people become scared that they will become a minority. Maybe in the future when the developing world is developed and the social inequality that causes a lot of legitimate problems is gone, we can have more open borders. Until then, we need moderate immigration policies and an emphasis on a foreign policy that actually helps people."

There's this concept... difficult to grasp for many progressives... known as a 'democracy' wherein the majority sets the priorities and agenda. Now, while I appreciate that there is the concept of 'Right' (which invariably is claimed as Holy Ground by the progressive Left) and 'Wrong' (which belongs by default to everyone EXCEPT the progressive Left) we, as a species and a society, have largely not evolved to innately recognize which of these labels individual issues fall under and consequently are incapable of dealing with said issues with wisdom, compassion, and grace. Unfortunate, I know. Thus the outdated and evil concept of 'democracy' still holds sway.

So what's the point of an anti-immigrant left?

Quote:

>This is the point where you have to ask yourself what Beinart actually thinks the Democratic party is for. Personally, I think any center-left party worth its salt has to be deeply committed to egalitarianism, not just for people born in the US but for everyone... That means fighting for LGBT rights against bathroom bills, fighting mass incarceration and police violence victimizing black Americans, and working for more domestic redistribution to address poverty and hardship, including through universal health care.

I disagree with Vox in that fighting for economic inequality and pushing for universal health care is realistically attainable, or perhaps compatible, with being tolerant and not-prosecuting undocumented low-skilled immigrants here in this country and not trying to deter any increases of them coming over here, in the given political climate we're in. For the economic inequality part, I believe there simply isn't any evidence that tolerating low-skilled undocumented immigrants will help better, and with the universal health-care part, I believe one of the biggest reasons of why America has up until recently not been fervently pro-universal mostly-government controlled healthcare is partially because of fears that it would be exploited and overtly stressed by undocumented immigrants and health-care tourists, as well for racist settlements related to that, that a portion of our population likely has. I believe if the Dems do come out with a more austere stance on immigration enforcement, and ensure that universal healthcare access would only be fully, or mostly, covered for legal citizens, that it would better their chances of passing it. Whether that would be less moral for the Dems to do that, I don't know, but I believe it would in it's course help their cause more with getting it passed, and inevitably help the American public, and be thus justified to do for it's potential outcome.

quote:

>But it also means treating people born outside the US as equals. It means generously funding foreign aid for health programs that have saved hundreds of thousands, even millions of lives. And it means a strong presumption in favor of open immigration. Not only does migration help native workers overall, it enables a massive increase in the welfare of people abroad, typically people much poorer than even poor Americans, who come here. Recent research from economists Michael Clemens, Claudio Montenegro, and Lant Pritchett estimated that someone from Nigeria who moves to the US will be able to earn $16,611 more every year than they would at home. For Indian workers, the number is $14,317; Mexican workers, $10,523; Cambodian workers, $21,352.

I don't think 'treating people born outside the US as equals' is realistically politically feasible as a policy stance for the party, nor would even be right. There's many economists who might agree that past immigration trends in recent US history haven't hurt workers, but I doubt many would agree that simply allowing open borders and travel and economic migrates will have no negative consequences for the average and lower-class Americans, or would be popular among the American public. We should put the welfare of the citizens and legal residents here first, then try to help people in other nations second if we have the resources. 

quote: 

>What kind of egalitarian would oppose that? And what is the point of a strategy for the center-left to win that means giving up on that goal?... Beinart argues that to continue on their current path, Democrats need to build a viable, durable coalition that supports efforts to “promote both mass immigration and greater economic redistribution.” I really, profoundly agree with that. For rich countries, accepting large numbers of immigrants is a basic obligation of justice, as is helping the poor at home, and left of center people need to be thinking hard about how to build an electoral and interest group coalition that can support both those goals. It’s not impossible but it’s not easy.

I believe that the aftermath of the EU migrant crisis--with the short but serious increase of anti-migrant populism that occurred and grew dramatically that has shown that this simply isn't feasible for a major political party wishing to get a majority of the legislature and political offices in their respective nations, to hold. Even though the populist movement suffered defeat in the Netherlands and France to signify it's potential end in Europe, you can not forget that those came AFTER the EU made far more pledges to drastically reduce migrations and major centrists parties and leaders pledge to take more austere immigration and assimilation stances. There is draw-backs to universal humanist egalitarian approach as this author proposes when they're in affect, and I don't believe it will help the Democrats prospects of ever wanting to see any of their policies apart of their party platform to take affect in the future. 

I think Trump--who I vehemently disagree with on most things--hit closer to the feelings and beliefs of the plurality of the electorate when he said, and made part of his campaign all about, making things 'America First'. I don't agree with that when it comes to international trade, or when it even comes to immigration, but if the Dems hope to win more offices, and by doing so, accomplish the things they want to be done, they should hit something similar--but less extreme--as their official party policy when it comes to their stance on immigration.

If America had a safety net system for it's workers like Germany does, which includes far more labor regulations; that has industry required co-determination and worker councils mandates for businesses over a certain size; that favors Unions; that has free-college tuition, that has a comprehensive and advanced job-training / apprenticeships and research, and trade-schools and programs for a portion of the students in their secondary school system and for their unemployed citizens; that has adequate mandated minimum and guaranteed PTO laws for full-time employees; that has formalize labor contracts; whose workers up until a certain high-income limit are covered by government insurance, and who also have stable and generous public pension and disability plans; and so on, then I wouldn't be critical of the DNC's stance as a party on the influx undocumented immigrants. For under the system I just described, pretty much near all citizens are well-protected and are given various accessible opportunities to services and protections that allows them to reach a more prosperous life if they're determined enough. But as it stands, this is no where the case as it is in the US. The Dems should first pursue those protections and foundation securities to our citizen labor force first before advocating for a even more egalitarian approach to immigration.   "
5767,As I read the article and read the supporting studies I think I came to the same conclusions you did. The author actually cited studies that disagreed with his conclusions.
5768,If a bridge collapses and kills you....it doesn't care how you got there.

5770,"I think white people fading as a majority is incredibly overblown and short sighted.

It takes very few generations for Latino and Asian populations to totally assimilate into American (white) culture. 

The past 40 years has seen a mass migration event so the differences between ""white people"" and immigrants from those groups currently look stark. 

It will fade quickly due to assimilation and intermarriage. If you ask most people if Ted Cruz, Mark Rubio or Charlie Sheen were white, without people knowing their history, most would say they are white. 

In my own social circle I know six couples that are Asian/White mix. I see nothing in their kids life that indicates they are any different than kids with two white parents.


As intermarriage between black peoples and others increase I assume much of their ethic identity will start to erode. (See a number of second generation NBA stars)

There will always be left/right political divides for whatever reasons are popular at the time. Every country has that.
But I do not believe it will be due to ethnicity of origin. This is a blip in history. 

Total assimilation after a couple of generations has been the history of America to this point, with the sad exception of the African American population. Hopefully now all will be included."
5771,"> Liberals want to make it easier to immigrate legally.

That's a pretty broad statement. "
5772,"Australian immigrants actually average a higher per capita income than native born citizens. This is due to their selection process.

They are completely uncompromising with people that enter the country illegally but are very liberal in allowing qualified applicants to immigrate, as 26% of the current population was foreign born. 

Their continued economic growth and rise in prosperity owes much to this allowing highly targeted populations to migrate in large numbers.


Canada has a similar no tolerance approach to people in the country without permission, making work or receiving basic services almost impossible."
5773,"We do have a merit-based component. That's how a lot of people who aren't refugees and don't win the green card lottery (a real thing) can't get here. There are a lot of qualified people who want to come over, and not enough slots in the merit-based part of the system."
5774,"It's not about blaming the Mexicans, it's about blaming bad immigration policy.

Something can be statistically good for the nation, but bad for the citizens. Mass migration of any type will have a positive impact on national GDP growth, so economist say that means it's good for America. Maybe, long term.

Short term mass migration can have a devastating effect on per capita income for the people directly competing with those immigrants for jobs. 

There are countries that have had smaller GDP growth than the US, but also much smaller population growth. Their citizens prospered even as the country looked as if it faltered.

Since 1980 the US grew from 220 million people to 320 million people. Most of that growth was from low skilled Latin American immigrants and their offspring. 

Adding a 100 million people in 40 years is a mass migration event and no country could absorb it without economic disruption to some segments. It hit our lower skill working population hard, while at the same time making life a struggle for the immigrants.

We need time to recover and absorb this new population and we will once again see incomes across the full economy rise. 

But it will not be possible for incomes to recover if the next 40 years sees the same level of non targeted migration as the past 40."
5775,And mass immigration of Italians did cause Americans to become extremely conservative at the time. The KKK gained a lot of members because people were *also* afraid of Catholics (which most Italians are).
5776,"The concept of 'white' exists only in contrast to the concept of 'black'; ergo not so long ago 'Irish', 'Italian', 'German', et. al. were distinct ethnic groups which have, in the United States, all been assimilated under the label 'white'. The United States census delineates between 'white hispanics' and 'black hispanics' and every 'white hispanic' family I know ALREADY identifies as simply 'white' except if there is an economic incentive to do otherwise. And they all hate Mexicans. I kid you not. Never mind their ancestry, they fucking hate Mexicans. I was like, 'wut'???

They hate the economic competition. Everyone on one side of the economic fence who have something hate those on the other side of the economic fence who (effectively) want to take it away."
5777,"I think you're way too optimistic. Immigration does cause income inequality if it's not carefully controlled. That alone is a problem. 

You might know a lot of Asian/white couples, but what about black/Asian, or Hispanic/black, or Asian male/white female, etc?We still have a long way to go.   

IDK what Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have to do with this. Do people think that white Hispanics aren't a thing or something? Hispanic = Spanish influence, Spain is a European country. There are hundreds of millions of white Hispanics in the world. I'm not surprised that people who are probably less than 10% non white genetically, are integrated into white America. 

Historically speaking, having this much diversity this fast is unprecedented. America is the first, so we need to be careful. Even Latin America is mostly just a mix between Europeans, native Americans, Africans, and their mixed race descendants, and they still have massive amounts of inequality and social issues after hundreds of years. Their problems were not caused directly by diversity, but it is a factor that exacerbates some of their problems (ie: white Brazilians being less willing to help people from their out group and such). Even the data Vox used in their article to show support for immigration was going up, still has the vast majority of people in the ""keep things where they are"" or ""reduce immigration"" camps.

""The findings that total payroll for low-wage jobs declined rather than rose as a consequence of the 2016 minimum wage increase is at odds with most prior studies of minimum wage laws.  These differences likely reflect methodological improvements made possible by Washington State’s exceptional individual-level data.  ***When we replicate methods used in previous studies, we produce the same results as previously found***.

Oh, it *long* predates Reagan. "
5849,How is the study flawed?
5850,I live/work in Seattle. This study is flawed. Didn't include local chains only studied wages under $20 an hour so if you made 19 and took a job at 20 the study made it look like it was a job loss. Lots of holes
5851,"Moved out of Seattle a couple years ago after graduating from UW (same university that made this study), and I'm tempted to disagree with this study and lean more toward the ones that found positive results from the wage hike. There's a [few](http://www.epi.org/press/university-of-washington-analysis-of-seattle-minimum-wage-increase-is-fundamentally-flawed/) [different](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/seattle-minimum-wage.html) places that provide a better explanation of the data and explain flaws with the study from UW. 

The most significant one I agree with is the exclusion of businesses with locations outside Seattle. Most people are writing these businesses off as 'large corporations,' which is true for some of them: at UW, most people I knew worked for franchises or corporations: Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Target, Tommy Bahama, McDonald's, Amazon, etc., were the most common jobs for friends in college. However, other, local businesses that definitely aren't ""big businesses"" are also excluded: Dick's Drive-In, Ivar's, and Ezell's Chicken, for just a few examples. Small credit unions like BECU are also excluded under this criteria. So I'd definitely say there's some flawed methodology. 

Washington *also* has a booming market for higher-paying jobs, which I believe [EPI](http://www.epi.org/press/university-of-washington-analysis-of-seattle-minimum-wage-increase-is-fundamentally-flawed/) references (already included a link to this study a little earlier). 

When I moved out of Seattle, rent was still going up by as much as landlords could manage (usually 10% at the end of a lease, with 30 days notice; I believe this is the legal cap, or 10% annually). The last time I was down by my old apartment, an entire block of old buildings had been torn down and replaced by apartments. We've still got a thriving economy, at least every time I go to Seattle: still congested traffic, packed streets, doesn't seem to be much of a change, and I haven't noticed an uptick in the number of homeless in the area by my old apartment (which had a large homeless population nearby) whenever I've been in the area. Just anecdotal, but for what it's worth."
5852,"> that study has already been debunked 10 ways to sunday

Care to share where?  That's strange considering the study hasn't even been published yet and is just a NBER working paper."
5853,"You do realize that this ""new"" methodology they used had glaring holes that economists are saying inevitably led to false data. By failing to establish a true control the resultant numbers are just numbers, drawing conclusions from this study is a fools errand."
5854,"Previous studies have never examined minimum wage hikes of this magnitude in this short of a time period. This is uncharted territory. This is precisely why the Seattle experiment is such a big deal.

It says right there in the study that the increase to $11 had very little effect (because relatively few workers were being compensated less than that in the first place) but when the move to $13 went into effect we started to notice significant effects. [source](https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/two%20page%20overview.pdf)

This is exactly what the models have predicted all along--that small increases wouldn't have noticeable impacts but the higher you raise it, the more you'll start to notice those effects."

5856,"This, but unironically."
5857,"It only reported on the loss due to less hours, not the net positive of the additional revenue. The net net was workers received more money for working less hours"
5858,"Lots of reasons, but one big one is that it excludes 40% of Seattle's workforce simply by excluding businesses that have multiple locations. So like, any fast food/service/retail/hotel chain workers.

5875,"It says right there in the study ""

5877,"To be fair, it's not just big businesses like McDonald's and Starbucks that suffer under the study's controls. These criteria exclude Seattle-based small businesses, like Dick's Drive-In, Ezell's, or Ivar's, based on the fact that they've got locations in Lynnwood, Edmonds, or Everett. I don't think those would really be considered 'big corporations' by most people and they're only in Washington, and in our area. Though they're not based in Seattle, BECU and other small credit unions likely fall into this category as well. They aren't small businesses in the sense of a family owned landscaping business or a small daycare, but they're still smaller businesses and primarily do their business in Seattle or the suburbs of Seattle."
5878,"It's cute how you just moved the goalposts to the viability of small businesses, when this article is about workers. 

If you are a small business that can't afford to pay a living wage, then your business is a drain on the economy and should fail.

5881,"Uh, what?

The 40% of *employees* left out of the study work for businesses with more than one location. The study didn't even look at big corporations. Or local restaurants / barbers / etc that have 2 locations. 

Where did you get your weird inference about big corporations from?"
5882,"stay on topic, that's a separate issue."
5883,"Because increasing their costs by paying workers more is totally benefiting /s (I understand that if all the small businesses go out of business, that leaves only large corporations who will still be profitable with their now decreased competition)

The small businesses that cannot afford to pay their workers more must not be very successful, else they should try and get additional tax breaks/ government subsidies to offset their new increased costs. 

It's not the business' fault that the law changed, but it's absolutely their fault that their own employees are living in poverty on minimum wage. The intent of the law is to keep people from living in poverty, and by paying employees a non-livable wage, the business has contributed to the problem. 

An analogy could be environmental regulations: let's say a new clean water standard is introduced that conflicts with a business' waste disposal practices, but adhering to the new standard is too costly and the business cannot afford it. Well they don't have a choice in the matter and will have to find a way to make it work or else they'll go out of business.

Businesses start and fail all the time. Successful businesses find ways to remain profitable despite the ever changing economy, laws, etc. If being a small business owner was easy, then more people would do it. Fact of the matter is, it's incredibly difficult and only the best survive."

This is precisely *why* they predicted that the wage hikes would hurt the poorest of society in the first place.

Unless you're saying that a poor minority working for a small business in a rough part of town with significantly lower costs of living should go to the swankier parts of town to compete with upper-middle class white kids for jobs that will pay him a few more bucks an hour.

As for how I support Republicans it will sound callous and no doubt earn scorn from many here who lean left but the overall values of the party align with my own even if I don't support some of the more radical ones like the current state of the AHCA.  When it comes to healthcare I'd much rather see us align with the rest of the free world and have a national healthcare single payer system but I'm not willing to sacrifice the rest of the direction of the country to the far left to get it.  If there was a moderate center party I'd support it 100% of the time but sadly we're now in a world where the DNC is getting farther and father left while the Republicans get farther right in response.  I don't want to go that far left of center... I don't like where that would lead us so I'll eventually need to just stop supporting anything when we get to the point where the Rs are too extreme right for my conscience."
5947,"Yeah that's not helpful. Hell, I've been attacked by the far left here for not being far left enough -- and I'm pretty far left! lol "
5948,"That was a fair answer. Thank you for that. You do sound like a republican that could vote Bernie. I like that too. What would you consider ""too extreme right"" at this point? We had an armed KKK marching on the streets yesterday in case you didn't hear about it. "
5949,"You had a chance to vote for a moderate centrist. Unfortunately, you couldn't bring yourself to vote for Hillary."
5950,"I did hear about it and it does trouble me but no more so then the riots that piggyback into what would otherwise be peaceful protest in the name of say Black Lives Matter or the G20 summit do.  There's radical elements on both sides and while there's no excusing it there's no denying it either.

As for what would be too far right things like a legitimate ""Muslim ban"" and not just a travel ban on select nations that have apparently become an intelligence concern would get close to the line.  An actual governmental endorsement of racism and not a sensationalist twist on it that is."
5951,"Hillary Clinton is not a moderate centerist and the fact that you think she is shows how little attention you paid to what little she actually said about her platform during the election.  Her platform, and the DNC as a whole, spoke almost entirely to minority and women voters to the intentional exclusion of white men or middle class people of any race or sex."
5952,"Not sure how you can compare the KKK, marching for white supremacy and the right to lynch men with BLM, marching against racism. These are not equivalents. 

I'm not defending riots or violence in any way but, in general, when ""the left"" marches is to defend the rights of those who can't defend themselves: kids with chronic illnesses,  LGBT rights, women's rights, healthcare for the poor, clean water, clean environment, social justice, rights of people of color, etc. What are the honorable things ""the right"" marches for?  I agree ""the right"" marches to protect the fetus from ""baby killing liberals"" but what happens to that baby after it is born doesn't seem to be worth protecting. 


The G20 riots happen every time there's a G20 meeting, in whatever part of the world. 

What would be too extreme for you:

1) A ""real"" Muslim ban... banning grandmas,kids, doctors, scientists and university professors is happening already. Are these people threats? The son of Muhammad Ali and his family was detained for hours in an airport, in case you didn't hear about it. Was that right?


2) ""An actual gov endorsement of racism."" Didn't we have this already? Until 1964? A bit unconstitutional, no? Is that your limit?

Sigh... yeah I did ask. Looks like your ""center"" is miles away from what I consider acceptable in a democracy with human rights and protections for citizens and the environment. Looks like that's too much to ask.

I better start marching.

Nevertheless the picture raises serious concerns and should raise doubts. Appearing on a split screen picture with a woman who was described by Trump operatives as representing the Russian government is certainly suspicious.

Further evidence the GOP has no shame."
6032,"There's several problems with this argument: 

- health care is a perverse market where the normal laws of supply and demand don't always apply. We see studies again and again that show areas that have more supply are often more expensive.
- It's state refusal to expand Medicaid--and the obvious threat that GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House pose to reimbursements-- that is scaring insurers away from the exchanges.
- The tax penalties for the individual mandate are scheduled to increase, providing more incentive for young, healthy Americans to pay into the system. The system needs everyone to participate to function well. That's how insurance works at this scale. 
- The argument points to rising premiums as evidence of Obamacare's failure. But they have to show how premiums would have been lower had Obamacare not passed. Healthcare costs are rising worldwide. 

Look, Obamacare is an imperfect solution to a very important, difficult problem. The hastily compiled, overly optimistic Republicare bill will not be a better system. "

What I do know is that if he does resign that shouldn't protect his family. The investigation into a foreign country messing with our elections and the possible collusion of the Trump administration can't go unfinished. If there is evidence that Trump and/or his cronies were mixed up with Putin's goals, then they need to face the consequences.

We made the mistake of letting Nixon off thinking that it was a one-time thing. We let Reagan off because people liked him. We can't keep letting presidents get away with this shit."
6045,Bull. He'll stay in as long as he can so he can pardon all his various lackeys. That's the only use he has right now. There's no way Congress will repeal the Magnitsky Act at this point -- Russia got busted thanks to Trump's incompetence.

Trump would love nothing more than the ability to sit back, have zero responsibilities, and rake in cash off of rubes who buy into his ""they were mean to me/I'm so great"" routine. It will also allow to to dodge some of the constant hate and ridicule that's been thrown his way; that would be a huge plus for someone as thin-skinned as Trump. "
6076,"No one has the stomach for prosecuting and jailing a president. I'm just saying, there is a reason it hasn't been done before"
6077,"Right, he likes them as props when he can use them to demonstrate his own greatness -- like his hotels or his golf courses."
6078,"As soon as his approval rating is below 30 Congress will be more than just ""concerned"" or ""disturbed"" by his behavior.  I am being patient."
6079,"It would make him a quitter. He wouldn't allow that. If he finishes his term, he gets to say the exact same thing: I was treated so unfairly. The media just lies about everything. Nobody allowed me to get anything done. Democrats only know obstructionism. Etc.  But if he finishes, he won't go down in history as a President who resigned. And he's in no danger of being impeached so he doesn't have to worry about that either.  At worst, he'll be Bill Clinton: impeached by not removed. But that's unlikely even if he wins a second term (never underestimate people's ability to vote against their self interest in the name of religion)"
6080,Then he'll be able to run Trump-tv and already have a decent following.  He's all about making money.

So then those two states are on par with Venezuela and they would not be a step up for those suffering under their socialist regime in Venezuela?"

They have him at 43% approval at the moment. The same firms reporting low 30s percentages are the same that had Hillary in the 70s in November."
6125,The same can be said of individuals. A Jewish person could use violence to suppress free speech. Would they be a Nazi?
6126,"Oh. Rasmussen is pretty bad.

Also did you notice that 43% is not 50%?"
6127,"> The same can be said of individuals. A Jewish person could use violence to suppress free speech. Would they be a Nazi?

Since it's what they do that defines them, yes.

You must be a republican. You seem to be seeing everything based on race and religion colored glasses. LOL!"
6128,"I was originally referring to the popular vote, but you're right, they did say ""still supporting."" And if accurately predicting one of the biggest upsets in US political history is bad, then yes, Rasmussen is just terrible."
6129,"One reference to a single Jewish person in a discussion about Nazis means I see everything based on race and religion? The Nazis meant to exterminate the Jews, which is why I asked about a Jewish person suppressing free speech. You see, by your definition this Jewish person would be a Nazi, a member of a group that was dedicated to, amongst other things, the extermination of the people of which this person is a member. That would be silly. It's called the Socratic method friend, asking questions to demonstrate an error in ones thinking. 

Not that it matters, but as an aside, I'm a liberal atheist, you're welcome to confirm this in my post history. Perhaps next time you should consider the topic at hand before making unfounded assumptions about people. Did you not consider that in a conversation about the Nazis and what it means to be one, the Jews might come up?"
6130,He didn't get 50% of the popular vote. Just stop.
6131,Damn you caught me rounding up. 46.1%.

But if I'm writing a review article on a drug that's only been on the market for 3 to 5 years, then my base is more limited, and since it's a straight up science article, then getting citations from women and non-white people isn't all that important, since science is objective data."

6474,"I think [this article](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446) is where it all comes from.

There was no Ukranian bot network, there was no Ukranian fake news specifically targeted at vulnerable swing districts, there was no strategically timed Ukranian leaks to Wikileaks etc etc."

I would like to say that not using the info is not enough to get them off the hook for me.  They also have to ***immediately notify the FBI/CIA*** about what they found.  That's the glaring problem with the Don Jr. meeting.  Even if nothing came of it the FBI should have been notified when it was made public 5 days later that Russia hacked the DNC."
6476,">A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.

>The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort’s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump’s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine’s foe to the east, Russia. But they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia’s alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails.

Pretty good summary.

So the Ukrainians (who knew Manafort well, as he had been fucking around in their politics for years on behalf of Russia) called in someone from the DNC and said ""Hey, this Manafort guy is dirty and not to be trusted. He basically works for the Kremlin.""

Fact is, this doesn't give Trump any praise from me because he was 100% for Iraq back in '03, therefore him changing his position later just makes him a hypocrite. Just like how he was for universal health care back in the 1990s, he sure as hell isn't for it now."

But, IMO, the Clinton camp has often explained their loss on the Russia factor. I happen to believe, that the Russia factor has an impact, but I don't know that this only factor decided the election. 

The Comey letter at the tail end of the election had a serious impact on the race. The polls started tightening considerably after that. After the Comey letter, everything was up in the air. 

BUT, the race should have never been so close in the first place. And there is where the dog is buried. There were systemic flaws in the Clinton campaign and with Clinton herself. She was so loathed and her support base was soft and it eroded quickly. The Comey letter was the last straw. IMO many more moderate republicans, who contemplated voting Clinton turned away from her, after the Comey letter, and held their nose and voted Trump. I honestly believe their votes in PA, WI and in MI would have sealed the deal for Clinton but she lost them at the end. 

The DNC has IMO moved on from the russia issue. It is relevant for the, but healthcare is more important for them.

6832,"Democrats should definitely look into the nomination  process closer.   

But even if the process hadn't been fixed, O'Malley would not have won.  He never had momentum in the campaign because he wasn't as ideologically appealing as Sanders, and he didn't have the organizational support/ name recognition of Hillary.  Ultimately the Dem nomination process achieved exactly what it was designed to do-  pick the most capable national candidate without selling out to an insurgent campaign. What they were missing was the high personal disapproval ratings that Hillary had. 

As bad as the primary process worked out for Democrats, the Republicans should take a close look as well.  They won the general, but in the process their candidate insulted, embarrassed, and corrupted the rest of the party.  Now he's doing the same to the entire country.  The GOP will shrink under Trump.  Ultimately the Republicans proved their process to be more responsive to the vicissitudes of their rank and file, but in so doing, they allowed the party to be hijacked by an unqualified demagogue.

6833,I thought we already knew this?
6834,Yes.  Now how's this going to help us get rid of Trump and the Republicans?

So much effort goes into protecting and making excuse for Hillary and it just makes you wonder how much more the left could get done if they did some actual fucking work instead? 

Edit: What was I thinking? The left doesn't want to do any work or focus on policies. They just want to bitch about how life is unfair and blame everyone but themselves. You fuckers deserve to keep losing. "
6841,Doesnt matter you'll see the Sanders fans jizzing over themselves from this story
6842,"What exactly would they do if they did go after Hillary, anyways? The DNC is a private organization and can do what they like internally. There might be a *civil* case to be brought against them, but nothing they did was illegal.

Meanwhile, collusion with agents of a foreign government to swing an election **is** illegal. A felony, in fact. Who the fuck cares about sad grandma and her *legal, if unethical, actions* in the face of that? If Donnie hadn't felonied his way into the White House, and Clinton was there instead, I might give a shit. But as it is, I'm focused on actual problems."
6843,The owner of this paper is a huge Trump supporter.
6844,"I don't think any amount of additional work would have let Hillary win. It's hard to win against a guy who's outright proven that he was colluding with foreign nations to cheat. Hillary's legal, if unethical, actions pale in comparison to that."
6845,Sanders fan here.  Voted for Hillary. Not jizzing.
6846,"Why don't you care the democratic party rigged the primary? Thats why we have Trump now. If they do it again..Trump will win a second term. It seems silly to dismiss this with so much at stake. Its what the democrats did last time. They said Trump is bad, Trump is bad, focus on Trump, look at him... not realizing their base is smarter than that. So very amazing people are taking this same exact losing stance again

6847,But O'Malley isn't. He needs to refocus on what matters.
6848,Oh so that means Governor O'Malley never actually said it then. Thanks for clearing that right up
6849,"Where is the proof of that? Huh? I want to know because everyone had hearsay about Russia with no fucking evidence whatsoever. Even this Trump Jr shit is just a matter of speculation. You three sides and two of them are outright denying collusion while the other claims collusion and its all based on what people THINK happened in a meeting. You know what was proven tho? That Hillary and the DNC colluded to keep Bernie down. That was in the DNC email leaks where this whole Russia story was invented to protect Hillary's lies. To this day there is proof of collusion with the DNC, Hillary, and the liberal mainstream media to keep Bernie out of the picture but only hearsay about Trump. The only collusion that is real is from the left so you guys like to project much or what? lol"
6850,"Its been a looooong time since the primary ended and I still have not been presented with evidence of 'rigging'. rude emails arent rigging. I've read all of those stupid emails. There's nothing there. an idiot tv personality sending unsolicited trivial questions to a campaign is not rigging. idiot sanders delegates not showing up to vote is not rigging. bill clinton showing up at a polling place is not rigging. red t shirts is not rigging. 

the dem base is women and minorities - not college age white people. "
6851,"hahaha yes becuase a white man said a woman cheated him...that makes it a fact

Where exactly did Hillary cheat?

O malley lost cause he had no personality whatsoever, To say someone was more boring than Al Gore  is not a compliment"

6854,"Here’s your proof straight from DT junior himself:

> This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump

That’s not speculation. That’s collusion with a foreign government."
6855,"> I still have been presented with no evidence of 'rigging'

Eh. People see what they want to see. For the life of me I can't figure out how this happen but I've encountered many people on this sub who are very much like Trump supporters. I have Trump supporting friends still saying show me the evidence of collusion. 

Also for some reason it's only on social media (Reddit specifically) that this happens. To quite literally everyone I know..it's common knowledge the DNC rigged the election against Bernie Sanders like Martin O'Malley is saying. 

There is currently a fraud lawsuit against the DNC for rigging the election. You can read there DNC lawyer's defense [here.](http://inthesetimes.com/article/20105/in-its-defense-against-fraud-suit-from-bernie-supporters-the-dnc-just-dug-i) He says they have every right to rig the election as they did. "
6856,">someone's opinion about a former politician 

Lol. This is a major news outlet in Maryland. That someone..is the former governor of Maryland and he just publicly confirmed that his own party cheated him and the other candidates in the presidential primary. It would be criminal for them not to report this. "
6857,"I agree but I did not support either and expected the worst from both so I am jack's complete lack of surprise lol This year was going to be fucked the second it came down to Hillary and Trump. With Hillary it was almost a guarantee that we were going to war with Russia because she practically salivating over the idea of constantly fucking with them and  just so we are clear, there is no guarantee we would win that fight. 

Russia is not the third world nations we have been pushing around. That would be an entirely different kind of war and we are not even close to ready for that. With Trump, I knew we were going to take a hit to our economy, that civil rights were going to be challenged, that we'd lose our healthcare, and that he was going to make us look like assholes to the rest of the world which is exactly what has been happening. Either way we were heading towards bad times it was just a matter of what kind of bad times. Averting a world war and taking a hit at home seems like the better deal imo. 

Hillary was playing a dangerous game with a country that could kick our fucking ass especially since most of the world would rally behind Russia just to get at us. Even today we are still poking at Russia just to protect Hillary when SHE was the one who actually got caught colluding in the primaries to screw over Bernie and half of her own base and for nothing more than her own personal ego. 

It was a lose lose and I'm sick of people acting like Hillary would have been like Bernie. No, not even fucking close. She was the most republican democrat that has ever run for office. Its still would have been business as usually for wall street, the banks, and big corporate, "
6858,"No that is a foreign government favoring a candidate. Nothing new there. Where in that did it prove that they hacked our election? THAT is collusion what people have been trying to prove since they came up with this bullshit lie. A lie, mind you, created to cover up the ACTUAL collusion between Hillary, the DNC, and the liberal mainstream media to screw over Bernie and he still almost won which speaks volumes of how unpopular Hillary really was. 

A DNC staffer leaked those emails to wikileaks and the real story is what was in them. Russia had nothing to do with it no matter how bad you want that to be the case. She lost because SHE played dirty and got caught. THAT is the only real story of collusion in the 2016 election. "
