0,"""We should have peaceful protests like during the Civil Rights Movement."" 

A handful of those protests were peaceful, as cops were beating protestors. Police violence against first amendment rights isn't peaceful. 

""This man was a part of a movement more like the Black Panthers.""

It has been stated many times he was part of no movement.

Still watching for some reason. 

Also, the Black Panthers stopped many police shootings while they were around. 

""I'm not racist.""

Whoops. 

Racism is a one-way street of systemic issues. 

I have to tell you something:  
Black lives matter and all lives matter are entirely different things. Cops shoot Asians at a lower rate than whites. Cops shoot blacks 2.5 times more than they shoot whites. Black people are more likely to live in poverty 5x more than whites, and 6x as likely to be arrested for a misdemeanor than a white man. Poverty has increased for black communities in many areas since Civil Rights passed. That's another reason it's not ""All lives matter.""

Black Lives Matter exists and doesn't mention white folks needing equality after two centuries of slavery, a century of blacklash to slavery, and fifty years of backlash to Civil Rights, because white folk never experienced that. This video is as ignorant as it gets. 

This video is the smallest part of the whole picture. The creator of it doesn't even know what the picture is. The creator of the video is scared. Black people should be having riots for the four centuries of constant oppression, and in some places they finally are. 

""You don't just look at a word, you look at the whole sentence. You don't just look at a chapter, you look at a whole book."" Does that mean you don't read but just look at the cover? I can look at a whole book without opening it because a whole book is a rectangle with words I don't read in it.

""They need to be for fac-fac-fact-fac-factordy reasons."" What's factordy mean? 

""Another reason we should have more guns."" What a thing to tack on right at the end. I don't want to say the creator of this video needs help. I will say the creator of the video has a lot of reading to do, lots of books and chapters and sentences and words to take in, lots of speeches to watch. I think that will be a great way to be helped and help that isn't so bigoted as this video."
1,"I would like to follow up by saying if OP also made the video, I love you and your life matters, but there are some people (11% of the US population) who have been oppressed for centuries and continue to be so oppressed that they are being beaten and arrested at their peaceful protests, that they have little access to education and wealth, and really need some other people (64% of the US population) to finally listen. India is protesting for Black Lives Matter. England is protesting for Black Lives Matter. France, Japan, Australia, South Africa, are protesting for Black Lives Matter. This is a big issue, and your voice matters, but it is important to assess all the facts beyond simply putting out one's own thoughts. Research before writing, research and edit. Learn and love. All lives matter, of course. That is implied in the first sentence of the Bill of Rights. Some lives, specifically black lives, have been trodden upon to the point at which much of the country has forgotten the KKK was one of the most untouchable organizations in the US barely over fifty years ago."

5,"A giant asteroid with the potential to wipe out all life (i.e. 1km or above in size) *could* hit us tomorrow. Thankfully the odds of it actually happening are 1 in 225,675,000."
6,Good news for everyone who picked an asteroid over Clinton and Trump
7,"To summarize the article, the only way the asteroid even gets near Earth, would be for its trajectory to be severely altered by a solar surface electromagnetic event. One that occurs at the precise moment, at the specific distance range, and with an absurdly strong energy level. Basically the Sun would have to repeat the highest ever recorded energy for such an event within a time frame of about .2 days.


The odds have been deemed a snowballs chance in hell


if hell had nuclear weapons, 21 century targeting systems, and an elite organization of rocket nerds tasked with destroying the snowball.


Seriously though, time is a resource. people will never be bothered to waste that resource on reading every single news article.  experience has shown them that they can get valuable information from others expressed in easy to understand terms. Its socially efficient to defer to people that seem smarter than you, and biologically ingrained to mirror other peoples feelings.


**TLDR:** Less than Puny chance of big rock hitting us. Sorry guys, you're gonna have to keep living on this planet. 

So recycle and go vote or whatever."

""so-called""? The FBI listed a number of violations in their investigation. This seems as clear as it could be. Not recommending prosecution (which isn't even their job, mind) does not mean those violations cease to exist. 
 
Patently false? Someone needs a dictionary. It's a shame Clinton supporters see negative truths as character attacks. 

She broke the law. She's violated a number of rules and regulations. She's certainly perjured herself now as well. 

If she was still SoS, she's be out for what the FBI found, for what the OIG report stated, and would never have any future chance at the Presidency. 

There's ZERO reason those consequences should not still apply to her today. 
 
I get that these people don't want to be on a ""losing"" side, but let's face facts and do what's right, for fuck's sake. Their status as a ""winning team"" doesn't ultimately matter--at all--when the nation's leadership is at stake.

These findings fly directly in the face of Mr. Freyer and his research team at Harvard.

130,I too have dreams of being born rich. 
131,HAHA. What? Inheriting 200 million dollars from your rich fuck dad. Yeah a real rags to riches story. These people are fucking mental.
132,">He’s almost the epitome of the American Dream. He took $1 million and turned it into a $10 billion portfolio — or whatever value you want put on it — he’s become an immense success.

Yeah, you fucking lazy poor bastards, if my dad can do it with only $1M dollars and controlling interest in his father's $200M real estate empire - why can't you?"
133,"Of course he is. Anyone can be successful, as long as you are born rich. "

167,"Legal pot is happening anyway. WA state just made 1 billion off of pot. Legal pot is up for vote in like 8 states this election. If California votes yes, illegal pot is done. No way any state government is going to say no to those tax dollars.

Climate change priority was happening anyway. That was the whole basis of Solandra and Tesla getting preferential treatment from the government

$15 min wage was happening anyway. There was already bipartisan support for it going back before the primary

It's because the citizens (in a direct democracy state) wrote the ballot measure, collected the signatures, and put it on the ballot- then voted for it.

172,"It's almost impressive how much bullshit there is in this post.

>Legal pot is happening anyway. WA state just made 1 billion off of pot. No way any state government is going to say no to that

We are trending towards legal pot. Democrats embraced it, due to Sanders, in a far more progressive way than before. And if you think no state government will refuse that, you're full of shit or you've never met the Republican Party. 

>Climate change priority was happening anyway. That was the whole basis of Solandra and Tesla getting preferential treatment from the government

No, it wasn't. Half the country, approximately, still deny its existence. Sanders got the platform to embrace a carbon tax and other progressive measures instead of moving to the center. 

>$15 min wage was happening anyway. There was already bipartisan support for it going back before the primary

LOL. For someone born yesterday, you're an excellent typist. This is flatly untrue.

>Sanders got a new job out of this and all his supporters got was a ""press release"" giving Sanders credit for these things that wrere already working their way down the pipe.

Bullshit. You're completely wrong on every point you made."

252,"Which has to be Hillary, because Trump has only talked shit. Hillary literally took 100 million from the house of saud and then started wars at Saudi Arabias behest. That was the entire basis of the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is looking to absorb the entire peninsula."
253,"This opinion piece is exactly right. The issue here is that one candidate has qualifications, the other does not. One candidate has a track record of public service, one does not. One candidate is based in reality, the other is not.

The election is about competence to lead the US government. Clinton is competent. Trump is not."
254,I like em both Trump should be Clintons VP or the other way around. 
255,Lol Bernie sold out to the person all the Bernouts hate
256,"I don't buy the argument that I have to vote for Hillary because ""Trump is a threat"". 

Hillary Clinton is a thug. Many other politicians have been in politics just as long, and yet very few have the thick cloud of controversy that constantly follows the Clintons everywhere they go.

It's not clear to me she can't do more harm than good. She is one of the most despised politicians of our generation - what kind of cooperation is she going to get from Republicans?

Having both Clintons back in the white house again is going to be a guarantee for investigations and special prosecutors, and further the divide between the two parties. 

Does anyone really think Hillary Clinton will be allowed to get much if anything done? Whether one thinks she is guilty or not, do we really want a president under constant investigation?"
257,Trump says mean things. Of course he is the most dangerous man in America.
258,"- Clinton would accelerate progress for the .01%, and leave the rest struggling and stumbling towards overt revolution.  

- Clinton would not take the necessary bold steps required to stem climate change because her sponsors would be impacted.  

- Clinton would take the U.S. relationship with Israel ""to the next level"" and not negotiate with China, which likely means more war.  Maybe nuclear.

- Trump OTOH is incompetent, racist, bigoted, disliked by most including his own party...and his impact is largely tbd.  

Our choices suck.  Expect you knew that."
259,I'll take the guy with a big mouth over the gal with bad judgement any day of the week.
260,Way to get the big lies out early so it numbs people to the smaller ones! I wonder hope many times they had to stop laughing and start over to get through a sentence stating Hillary Clinton respects the Constitution.
261,Honestly didn't know which one it would be until I opened the article. 
262,"Another opinion piece based on pure denial-based fantasy. 

> Clinton is well within established bounds of competence, knowledge, commitment and integrity. 

Fantasyland. 

> ""Clinton's not a dumpster candidate""

HAH 

And a dumpster would do a better job holding onto classified information.

263,The thought of donald as commander-in-chief should make the whole world take pause.
264,Washington post
265,[deleted]
266,"is it the one that got off scot-free after confirmed sharing classified information on the basis that they're ""not sophisticated enough"" which is a nice way of saying ""they weren't smart enough to realize it was classified"" despite being 4th in line for the position they're vying for now, and that's only the latest of that growing trail of controversies fitted with this persons career, nor list hypocrisies

Or is it the loud-mouth idiot who's xenophobia is, sadly, proven correct a month or two later in some new event, that the a portion blames on them for opening their mouth in the first place as if begging for it to happen like the antique excuse of rape of ""dress better, you were asking for it."" Who's also more for states themselves to decide on matters of the social to that level of economy, not having a ""one size fits all"" on a diverse country. Who also says a scientific confirmation is a hoax from china.

Tell, me, which one is a threat, the one who openly does this and gets away with it in the system they want to control, or the one who's hated by both establishments side, who'll likely be blocked by both parties in everything they do.

No seriously, tell me, i'm too busy to read the article, the irony of typing this out though doesn't escape me."
267,"buuuuhe, pay attention to us!"
268,"This is exactly backwards.

Clinton as President will come in with the blind loyalty of Democrats who have sat idly by - or actively cheering on - an Obama Administration that has decided to rule by imperial decree rather than legislative consent.  Such a President is a serious threat to democracy.

In contrast, Trump may not be a particularly good President.  But he's not going to get the sort of blind loyalty backing him, so there will be significant checks on his power.
"
269,"Curious: Who would you prefer if there were a gun to your head? I'm honestly leaning towards Trump (because a victory attained through deception and lies isn't really a victory), but curious how others in my position feel."
270,Which one is a threat to the establishment?
271,So are you arguing that Trump is less of a threat because we can't trust anything he says? 
272,Hillary Clinton started wars at Saudi Arabia's behest?  Are you on medication?
273,the reason she's not indicted is because she's described as incompetent....
274,"If competence was a job and these were the two people interviewing for it, you would restart the hiring process."
275,I know it's not Breitbart or WND but an oped from a major news paper seems like a decent enough source to warrant discussion. 
276,"damn, never seen that before

She truly is a psychopath. She and anybody who votes for her have to be considered a potentional danger to the world's peace."
277,Comey stated many times during the hearing that he was referring to Hillary not being sophisticated technically...in other words...she doesn't really understand computers.  She did not have one on her desk.  He was not implying that she was too stupid to understand classified info.  Hillary is by no means a stupid woman.
278,"The dude who said himself that he could shoot someone in the face on 5th avenue in broad daylight and his supporters wouldn't care, doesn't have blind loyalty?"
279,Trump's entire brand is one giant deception
280,[Neither. I'd get shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSt6q0K1KTw)
281,"The one who isn't a career politician (if you can call having a career for only the past 16 years a ""career"") with countless corporate backers.  Funny how it was obvious who the threat to national security was. "
282,"Hillary has a proven track record of being a war criminal on a payroll of foreign goverments.

There is a slight chance that Trump may turn out differently."
283,The reason she's not indicted is because the FBI didn't find anything to indict her for.
284,"Trump is profoundly ignorant about what are government actually does and what it involves. He doesn't know what's in the constitution. He doesn't know anything about our foreign policy alliances. He doesn't know anything about our nuclear forces (he didn't know what the nuclear triad meant). 

He's not a serious or competent candidate. "
285,No I wouldn't. I would hire the person who has decades of experience.
286,Liberal left wing garbage is not a decent source
287,"Just because WaPo isn't a tabloid doesn't mean it's impartial when it comes to the election. If you were informed you'd realize the owner of WaPo has a vested interest in cheap overseas labor and therefore has a bone to pick with Trump.

Edit: sp"
288,"The only time I ever heard a real laugh from her is when she was joking about killing someone, ""we came, we saw, he died."""
289,"you're trying to tell me we should trust some one to lead the free world who doesn't understand computers in the slightest, despite that hacker-warefare could be the most effective tool of war in the modern era?

Isn't the eastern-sea board powergrid still in that apocalyptic-creation state of if one thing goes down, entire grid goes down?"
290,\#ImWithRorschach
291,"Trump is still part of the establishment, the economic one that is, judging from his refusal to release tax returns"
292,"Actually, I was assuming that both would be threats to national security."
293,How do you mean a war criminal? 
294,"that's factually wrong though...

the questioning the guy literally stated yes to the question ""did her lawyers have access to classified information.""

they quite literally let her go because they thought she was an idiot during it all."
295,Other people in the same situation as her got it much worse.
296,Lmao ok 
297,Or they made a bad judgment call. Her morals remain a tricky point with her.
298,"so much for that ""Anti-establishment"" idealistic nonsense i've heard from reddit with the sanders circle jerk, guess it's just pro-stereotype of politician."
299,Experience at?  Her failures far outweigh her successes.  
300,"Sure, all those pulitzers were for being left wing garbage. How many have Breitbart won?"
301,Having limited knowledge about how computers work has nothing to do with trustworthiness.   Lots of people over 65 only  know how to work basic functions like email and how to google.  People over 65 were not raised around computers...and it takes years of constantly playing on them to figure them out.  I'm pretty sure Hillary had more important things to do...she had staff to operate  the computer. 
302,"Do you think the President is in charge of that? I don't need my president to be an IT specialist. I need him/her to put the proper people in those positions and call the plays that need calling. I want someone who has trusted advisers and listens to their advice. I don't want someone who says ""I consult myself."" I don't care if she doesn't know where emails go before the wind up in their recipients inbox. I want someone who's not a loose cannon and doesn't feel the need to argue with everyone who says something bad about him. "
303,"You telling me you would trust someone to be president of the United States who didn't know how to perform repairs on a modern automobile, despite he fact that our entire defense apparatus depends on sophisticated internal combustion engines?"
304,I figured a person could deduce that I was speaking about the political establishment. 
305,You can speculate what Trump would do but so far only 1 person in the race has actually made decisions that we can analyze. 
306,"Hillary secretly pushed for a military coup in Honduras,  and rebel coups in Libya and Syria.

hundreds of thousands dead as a result of her actions."
307,"2 million dead people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other places mean war criminal.

Or at least it would mean war criminal if there was ever any accountability for the victors."
308,Attorney-Client privelage supercedes classified status. She could have also shared the details during Confession.
309,"No, you just don't like that fact.

If they had found something to indict over, they would have recommended indictment. They didn't.

The Republicans are in the position of complaining until they got the investigation they demanded and then when the investigation revealed that their claims about Clinton were baseless, they blame the investigators instead looking at why they were making baseless claims to begin with.

This isn't the FBIs problem. It's the Republicans' problem."
310,"Actually, no one even investigated previous Sect's of State who did the same thing.

"
311,"I tend to believe that the FBI is competent at investigation.

"
312,"that's the WORSE reasoning i've seen, because you ruin your point IN YOUR POINT.

If she had staffers handle the computer, wouldn't they at least, AT LEAST, study effective security? She can't even pick competent people."
313,"refer to one of the replies i gave to some one else in this train-wreck of a comment chain on how she handled the servers, hiring some ""expert"" to do it themself, failing HORRIBLY at it."
314,She clearly did not appoint anyone who was both competent and willing to tell her when what she wanted was illegal while SoS
315,"are they dealing with those engines themselves? No.

Are they going to deal with computers constantly? Yes.

Did they fail basic security functions with a computer server? Yes."
316,It's just really naive to say Trump isn't part of the establishment because he has never been a career politician. His greed still goes back decades and has been fucking America up just like any other politician.
317,I can't even begin to speculate what Trump would do. I don't even think Trump can speculate what Trump will do.
318,"Which part, specifically, was a war crime though? That's my specific question. "
319,"Did Hillary authorize the use of chemical gas or something? Did she deliberately order strikes on civilians?

It doesn't sound like a claim with much behind it. "
320,I'm going to need a source for that.
321,[removed]
322,There were no SoS who did the same thing.  Powell occasionally used a private e-mail account for gov't business and Rice didn't use e-mail at all.  Not the same as setting up a private server and never appointing an IG who would have told you to cut it out.
323,"I'm not referring to other secretary of state's. I'm referring to David Petraeus, Sandy Berger and Scooter Libby who were in similar positions as her and had some form of punishment. Comey even admitted that people in the same circumstances would have gotten harsh penalties."
324,"Was Nixon jailed or convicted over the Watergate shenanigans, though?"
325,All I was doing was letting you know how Comey used the word sophisticated.  You seem to think he was saying she was too stupid to understand classified material....which was not the case.
326,Nothing she wanted was illegal though. According to the FBI. 
327,To even suggest that he is on the level of HRC when it comes to being a part of the political establishment is a serious leap in logic and frankly makes you look like an unintelligent shill. 
328,"> I can't even begin to speculate what Trump would do. 

 This shows a lack of imagination.

>  I don't even think Trump can speculate what Trump will do.

 I think this is all he has been doing.
"
329,"Given that Trump has a ""good brain"" I think he can speculate as to what he would do.  Likely something wall related.  The guy is into building shit after all.  Probably have **TRUMP** in big lights all over the fucking thing too."
330,So then you have no basis for calling him a threat to national security.
331,"Yeah let's parse words around ""war crime."" As is the Clinton way. Love to parse words.

What is ""is,"" really? What does (c) mean, exactly? What is *sex,* technically?"
332,[removed]
333,"She has in fact personally authorized drone strikes, some of which killed civilians. That was the justification for using her blackberry for TS/SCI information; drone strikes needed to be decided upon quickly and there wasn't enough time to relay decisions through the proper channels. In at least one instance she would've had to leave a Christmas dinner to rain death down in Pakistan."
334,"The man who said that no prosecutor would bring charges in this case?

Those were his words."
335,None of those cases were the same as Clinton.
336,No. Ford gave him a pardon. Everyone knows this. 
337,"Well, Nixon resigned."
338,"He wasn't indicted, only named as an un-indicted co-conspirator. Then he was preemptively pardoned by his hand picked lackey of a successor."
339,"Yes, an extremely crucial part of modern society, and her first picks are hacks and fools. GREAT COMPETENT LEADER CHOOSE PEOPLE OF SAME SKILL LEVEL."
340,"That is not true. Her behavior fell under the portion of the relevant code covering gross negligence. Comey pointed out that violations under that section are generally handled with administrative sanctions, but they are still illegal."
341,"To be fair, saying the guy who made his money off of investments backed in large part by Citi, Merrill, BofA, and now Deutsche Bank isn't backed by corporate interests is ridiculously disingenuous.

He gave 50 million of his own money to his corporation. Who helped him get that money?"
342,"He's already endorsed systematic torture, he's totally alienated most foreign allies, and he's said that America needs to stop Iran's nuclear program ""by any means necessary.""

There's a little comfort in knowing that he probably doesn't mean most of the things he says, but that's still not very comforting."
343,Calling someone a war criminal is a pretty serious charge? You sure you don't want to be more specific with your words?
344,/u/transient_sentient is a pedophile!  How do I know? Because apparently words - even incredibly inflammatory ones - can mean whatever some salty guy on the internet wants them to mean!
345,"Or just don't use ridiculous hyperbole and have an adult conversation. No fucking wonder American's can't have conversations about politics at the dinner table.

Throwing around calling people war criminals is ignorant hyperbole just as throwing around facist is when Trump comes up in conversation"
346,"1. It's my cakeday, so unless you think this account was sold to Clinton then there's no way.

2. If I could get paid to circlejerk on r/nfl, then I would spend all of my time there (check my comment history). "
347,"yeah, the reasoning was she's too dumb to have realized.

You're not helping your case."
348,"Yes they were, all mishandled classified information and got in trouble for it. How are they any different?"
349,"> He wasn't indicted

Exactly. But even in the face of an un-indictment, Comey made it clear that the handling of sensitive government materials is not her thing."
350,Agreed but its been evident forever how candidates statements on the campaign trail usually do not have a correlation to what policies they will enact when elected. 
351,I'm not making a case. The FBI did that already.
352,Comey made it clear that there was no reason to indict her. That not the same as a co-conspirator.
353,"no, you're trying to make the case that hill isn't incompetent.

the fbi made the case of she is, which is why she's not in trouble.

stop going around in circles bro."
354,"The case they made was that she was negligent by incompetence, not purposefully negligent."
355,"> Comey made it clear that there was no reason to indict her.

Comey or Ford?"

He was more preoccupied with ""finding out which congress member were communists"" and making idle threats that actually doing anything.

To my eye, we now have a President who is thoughtful and intelligent. I am cheered by the fact that other nations look to him as a leader. The contrast between his Presidency and the Bush years is intense. Our allies viewed Bush as intellectually challenged and not up to the job. President Obama has restored our standing to much of the world. He is well spoken and intelligent, and I feel proud to have him representing us to the world. "

I agree though in the past Republicans had no hope of winning it. There are a lot of reasons to think it will be Red this time around. Not the least of which is that over 160,000 registered voters changed their party affiliation this year to Republican likely just to vote for Trump in the Primary. The Pittsburgh region went Republican for the first time in 2012 and Trump is way more popular then Romney ever was here."

514,"No she doesn't. For example Obama lied about Gun Control and Hillary says she is very anti-second Amendment and He lied about being Pro-coal and Hillary is starting right out of the gate saying she is going to put coal companies out of business. 

But those are all moot points. For some reason some people on Reddit think Hillary will have this enormous advantage in any State Obama won. You can't comprehend that Bush won nearly all the swing states twice just before Obama. Things are completely different then 2008 when Obama ran and Mitt was a weak Canditate going against a sitting President. But anyway you forgot to explain to me why you think Hillary's platform will appeal to Pennsylvania."
515,That one demographic isn't enough to win PA. 
516,Because her platform is no different from Obama's... it appeals to the same people Obama's platform appealed to. 
517,There isn't enough White People and Elderly People in Pa to win the state? That is news to me. Only like 1/2 of eligable voters vote you know.

520,No I don't. anyone who thinks Trump is going to win has their head in the sand. 
521,You know a black person can vote Republican and a white person can vote Democrat? There is a small group of people on here that really like to try to play identity Politcs to justify why Hillary will win. It is very off putting and frankly at some point actually becomes racist. Anyway it is a myth about Trump Supporters being poor and uneducated. They are actually wealthier then average Americans.
522,So does Trump have the same platform as Romney had?

541,"Imagine that you’re sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don’t get any. So you say “I should get my fair share.” And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, “everyone should get their fair share.” Now, that’s a wonderful sentiment — indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad’s smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn’t solve the problem that you still haven’t gotten any!

The problem is that the statement “I should get my fair share” had an implicit “too” at the end: “I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.” But your dad’s response treated your statement as though you meant “only I should get my fair share”, which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that “everyone should get their fair share,” while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.

That’s the situation of the “black lives matter” movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.


The problem is that, in practice, the world doesn’t work that way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn’t want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That’s not made up out of whole cloth — there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it’s generally not considered “news”, while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate — young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don’t treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don’t pay as much attention to certain people’s deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don’t treat all lives as though they matter equally.

Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase “black lives matter” also has an implicit “too” at the end: it’s saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying “all lives matter” is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It’s a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means “only black lives matter,” when that is obviously not the case. And so saying “all lives matter” as a direct response to “black lives matter” is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.

""All lives matter"" (ALM) is not a movement. There are no meetings. ALM is a basic human characteristic. If a house is burning down on a street, BLM is just saying we need to throw water on the burning house. The logic behind ALM seems to suggest we throw water on all the houses. The problem is, the house burning down has been doing so for a long time, due to many socioeconomic reasons beyond its control. "
547,Is the world out of rubble to stand on?
548,"Yes, Guiliani I agree, it is a name and idea being used by racist conservatives to create backlash against African Americans. 

Just like you are doing now and just like how all the media now use, BLM or Black Lives Matter in any incident made by any AA on any topic.  

So if this movement is going to be given credit for turning this election for Trump, at least introduce us to the leaders, and most importantly who is funding and who is getting the name in all the news?  

That is  no accident in the extremely controlled dialog and narrative of this nation.

Until black people reject the religous scripture of american blackness driven by activists and their priesthood of racial studies and start accepting cold hard facts no matter how uncomfortable they may be.

565,"You're answering your own questions and just not seeing it - the racism in our society is systemic, and is integrated into all of your points. 

For example, why do more black men drop out of school? Well, many young black men go to school in urban areas. Those urban schools are funded by the tax base that the school serves. Prior to the civil rights movement, very few black families saw much in the way of upward mobility out of poverty, for a variety of reasons that can be traced back to American slavery. After the civil rights movement, segregationists moved away from urban areas with integrated schools. The result of which is that the wealthier white people left, and there weren't any wealthy black people, so now the schools were reliant on a disproportionately poor tax base to fund their schools, especially as compared to schools that those white people who moved away could afford - further increasing the disparity in education quality - and therefore the available opportunities - between black and white students. When those schools are bad enough to be essentially a non-functioning waste of time, dropping out isn't a very hard decision."

Prove it. Because the only law on the books that favor one race over another is affirmative action.

Theres so much wrong with this statement i dont know where to begin. First you completely absolve black responsibility for and misidentify ""white flight"" immediately after civil rights was passed was when black leadership, in order to maintain their power base, started with the self segragation rhetoric of malcomx, black panthers, nation of islam, etc. They sent a loud and clear message that black people were to be left alone. Then you have the race riots which demonstrated, as they continue to do, that black people are willing to burn down oother peoples property and attack unrelated people in anger over any perceived slight....who wants to live next to that? Once more it wasn't just whites that fled it was anyone with the means. The rich and upper middle class blacks also fled. This is how motwon ended up out in LA. Because no one wants to live next to violent mobs. 

> so now the schools were reliant on a disproportionately poor tax base to fund their schools,

So what. This effects poor whites as much as it does poor blacks and  the quality of the school doesnt remove the need for an education. Nor is it the sole determiner of success. Normalization of valuing education and hardwork in the home is a greater determiner of educational achievement than the quality of the school. It's the parents enforcement of education at home that is a greater determiner of a childs success. Once more this isnt the 60s there is untold amounts of free education online everything from cooking to MITs entire curriculum can be found online. Lets not forget that primary education is such a shit show the country over that now colleges need to offer remedial classes just to bring freshmen up to speed."

699,"Yes for the same reason Louis Farrakhan and Jeramie Wright were  brought up against Obama, they were nationally recognized racist supporters of said candidate (plus many people thought that Obama may have racial bias against white people). The interesting thing here is that even if this guy openly supported Hillary or something it wouldn't matter as much because she isn't black so people won't think that she shares his racist views.


So yeah ""unknown racist guy says something racist"" isn't really a story.......now ""nationally recognized racist guy supports a candidate that many people already think is racist""........that's a story.

But that in no way prevents us from calling this shooting what it is.  These officers were targeted specifically because they *were* police officers by a guy with a very specific political goal in mind.  I'll leave whether instilling fear into the minds of officers was the goal or merely a convenient side-effect alone, but either way, I don't see how this is the textbook definition of domestic terrorism."

He has blood on his hands for dead officers and other people because his words have caused riots and uprisings. I have no problem with the president weighing in on a subject after someone has their day in court but he says things and makes accusations of people being guilty and racist before the body is even cold and the facts are out. How is someone supposed to get a fair trial when the President is publicly condemning them before they are even charged with a crime.

They commit assault and battery, they shoot unarmed citizens, they rape women in custody, and they sell drugs from evidence rooms. They need to be drug-tested themselves, including for steroids."
752,"> blacks cops kill is a complete non-issue when compared to the number of blacks other blacks kill.

754,I'm sure that is in the Reddit constitution because I have found that /r/Politics and particularly certain moderators on the sub go out of their way to block free speech that doesn't agree with their ideology. That doesn't bother me on a pro Hillary or Trump site but /r/Politics should be for everyone and ALL politics and opinions. 
755,">Haha, if he waited he would get crucified for not saying anything. He's the president, he's supposed to lead and set the tone. It's just that the right wants to hyper-interpret everything he says to be some reverse racism shit.

A president can make a statement about anything in a smart, sensible and responsible way.

He could have said something like: 'regarding the shooting that took place in Minnesota today, there was a tragedy that happened involving a police officer in the line of duty in which a civilian was shot and died from his injuries. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family and I can promise you that a full investigation will be done to make sure that no laws were broken and the officer acted in accordance with the law. I have already instructed the justice department to oversee the investigation and if any laws were broken then justice will be served.  In the meantime I ask all of our citizens to remain calm and wait for all the facts to come out and the legal process to take its course.' 

That would have been a perfectly reasonable and more importantly responsible response to this and every other shooting or similar situations that has taken place during his presidency. "

779,BLM haven't killed anyone. What about anyone who endorses the Police in the last week? Is that condoning killing civilians? Of course not.

783,"That's the genius of BLM.   

They have no members, so technically they have never committed a crime, never thrown bricks at police horses, blocked highways and ambulances, killed 5 cops etc.

Those are just all random acts not tied to BLM rhetoric at all!

However, let's just be clear, Trump's rhetoric is 100% to blame for all violence at his rallies - even violence *against* his supporters.  

"
784,"OK since you've created equivalence between BLM and Trump, which is correct?  Are they both to blame or are neither to blame?"
785,Killed 5 cops? Two protesters were also shot by the gunman in Dallas. He was not BLM.
786,Trump supporter? Lol? What a joke.
787,"People should be responsible for their own actions.

These two are equivalent *in that* they have both been accused of violent rhetoric.  Otherwise, not really - Trump is actually accountable for his words and actions and they can all be traced to him - with BLM that's not possible as they have no official membership rolls.

Yet the media denounced Trump for months, and his 'rhetoric' has undeniably led to less violence and death - it's not even close.

Don't have to be a Trump supporter to call out double standards.   "

792,"You have to admit Hillary is good at what she does.

If she had America's best interest in mind she could be a truly great President.

I still hope she will decide to do that. She will be breaking her pact with either her corporate benefactors or the American people. I don't see much reason she can't just decide that it will be the billionaiyuhs who get the shaft, this time.

optimistic sure, but anything is possible."

795,"?

Do you think giving classified information to people without clearance is something that a responsible person would do?"
796,"It depends who one is responsible to.

what Hillary did was just a way of Hillary being responsible to her corporate benefactors. She wanted Sid's advice because he is a well connected guy who could advise her on a course of action which would suit interests other than the American people's.

What I am saying is that if she were to decide to be responsible to the people, one day, she could absolutely be a great statesperson.

I just don't have any reason to think she will do that."

803,"That is an incorrect description.  The crime requires knowing acts, without knowledge there is no crime.

806,"I'm a huge Bernie supporter. I loathe Clinton and Trump, and would never vote for either. But Bernie has to do this at this point, and I understand and don't blame him. Why?

Because he used his endorsement leverage to transform the Democratic party platform on a multitude of issues, like healthcare, college, death penalty, marijuana, etc. And he got Hillary herself to endorse the public option and be down for some version of tuition free college. 

The guy's started a movement where dozens of Berniecrats have already won recent elections and thousands are planning to run in every state at every level of government. 

If he didn't endorse Hillary and ran third party, what would happen to those reforms in the platform and Hillary's newfound progressive stances? They'd disappear. He is stuck. He has to play ball now or lose everything he's worked for over the last couple months."

808,Good for him. Still not voting for her.
809,"If he wants to remain a democrat, he has to endorse the democratic candidate.  Same for Warren.  Not so surprising or tragic."
810,"First Warren, now Sanders himself? And what does ""selling out"" mean here exactly? Apparently making a pragmatic decision out of the available options is selling something to someone?"
811,"Holy shit, what the fuck is that website?? It looks straight out of 1998."
812,"It's called *being a grown up.* 

His politics and Hillary's overlap about 90%, his and Trump's about 5%. Bernie is doing what's best for the country."
813,Hillary will only pander Bernie supporters to get their votes but not actually do anything for them after she gets them.
814,"Stay salty, my friend."
815,"I don't get why this is upsetting people.   If you are a Bernie supporter and through the primaries I myself was.   You must realize that he tries to do what is best for the country.   I get it you don't like Hillary  but Bernie has to do everything he can do ensure Trump loses because Trump is the worst case scenario.  

Bernie has repeatedly said that he would take Hillary over Trump any day even during the debates and even just recently.   Remember his statement ""‘On her worst day Hillary is 100 times better than any Republican""  It really seems that a large portion of people here are very emotionally invested in but don't actually  listen to Bernie."
816,Bernie knows that the best way to enact his policies is to have a united Democratic party in November that carries more progressives into congress and 5 Supreme Court seats appointed by Democrats for the first time in 40 years. 
817,"Let's just hope she only gets 4 years and maybe we can put some real progressives in Congress in the meantime. If we want to shift the conversation more in that direction, while the Presidency would be nice, there are 500+ other seats progressives could aim for on the national level; not to mention all the state and local positions."
818,So much for being principled.  The DNC platform is non binding.  He sold out his supporters for nothing but empty promises.  Now he will campaign for the candidate of Wall St and corporations.  
819,Bernie Sanders(D). Welcome aboard bros.
820,Really harsh headline for a respectable man that changed the game. Where are the Trump is a pedophile headlines?
821,Apparently selling out is endorsing the person that only agrees with you 95% on the time.
822,[deleted]
823,"> No. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.

That is a lovely thought to have in fiction but rarely holds up in the real world.  Sanders is looking at his options.  A third party run even if he pulled his Democratic backers, and got both the green and libertarian parties to fully back him doesn't lead him to an electoral college win.  He could sit back and do nothing and let the cards fall where they may.  Or he can back Clinton and in doing so negotiate out concessions and votes she will push for if she wins.  

Not everyone buys into the idea that 4 to 8 years of trump will not be that bad and send the rest of the Democratic party running to the left.  So he appears to be willing to back Clinton to gain leverage for him and his wing of the party in the coming years if there is a Dem win and a Dem congress."
824,I pray that he comes up on stage and Endorses Hillary ONLY because the other option at this point is Trump or Johnson (whose voters will ignored during the Electoral College process)
825,Bernie is a good man that knows the nation will do well under Hillary.  Goof for Bernie and good for his supporters that don't turn on him like a pack of rabid weasels 
826,Bernie is a socialist. Hillary is a totalitarian.
827,The moment the Bernie cult is told there is no Santa Claus.
828,He has the same choice the rest of us do - Hillary or Trump. 
829,Anyone who refuses to play hard to get and sit on the sidelines while their progressive agenda gets ignored is a sellout apparently. 
830,Purity trumps actually getting stuff accomplished for some.
831,Yeah but once Bernie sees how heavily downvoted this is on Reddit he's totally gonna change his mind.
832,"His policies and Hillary's come from fundamentally different places. This whole 90% agreement thing is not convincing. 

I knew he would eventually support her because he said he would. That isn't selling out, IMO, it's doing what he said he would do.
"
833,There's nothing grown up about supporting a person like Hillary for a position of powerful leadership. 
834,"This is my concern. The Democratic Party could have a straight-shot progressive platform copied word for word from Bernie's own campaign website, and I still wouldn't be able to believe that they (and especially Hillary) has any intention whatsoever of delivering on those goals (or attempting to). They have lost their credibility, and when they don't have credibility, taking a certain stance on a position doesn't really carry any weight. "
835,This. Bernie disappointment should turn into local and congressional campaign movement. That will be a much more effective and lasting change than electing one person president. 
836,It all about that Primary in 2020. Build a challenge that can't be stopped for 1-term Hillary. Toot toot!
837,"Bernie and his supporters cannot be counted as a single entity. Just because you got one, doesn't mean you will get the other. "
838,You mean someone that will pander using your popular ideas? 
839,"Bernie didn't push a single person away from Clinton, and he doesn't even have the power to do so. The only person who pushed people away from Clinton was Hillary Clinton. Sometimes you need to accept reality and blame Hillary Clinton for her own shortcomings as a candidate. She is not entitled to our votes, and Bernie didn't deny them to her by running. "
840,"Not only is it not convincing, it's not honest. People use the fact that Bernie and Hillary voted with 93% similarity in the Senate as a testament to this idea that they share 90% of their views. It's true that they voted the same way 93% of the time, but very little legislation that makes it to the floor is actually remotely liberal, so there's no telling how similarly they would have voted if there was actual progressive legislation at stake. 

Edit: I guess objective truth is worthy of downvotes. "
841,"OK, you're smarter than Bernie, and you know what's in his heart better than he does, so your incisive analysis of his and her positions on the issues (hack, cough) is MUCH more persuasive than his endorsement. SARCASM.

A hater's gonna hate."

846,"Its misleading because you could use the same logic to say Hillary and Trump are the same because they are both on the same side when it comes to keeping murder, rape, etc illegal."
847,"LOL. You had to do a lot of mental gymnastics to get from what I said to your interpretation of it. 

Bernie is a democratic socialist. There is a huge ideological difference between democratic socialism and the American democratic party. There are obvious pragmatic reasons for him to caucus with the democrats, to do what he said he would do, etc. "
848,"Hmm, wonder how I've been a Redditor for two years but my account is only 15 days old. Could it be that my account is over two years old?"

Educate me please. It may be helpful to check [this link about creating tables in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/wiki/table-format).

What I do know is that the Democratic Party's policies have been transformed over the period that I've been paying attention, recently accepting the consensus support for gay marriage, and more recently endorsing the $15 minimum wage and better public funding of higher education. It's a dynamic party that's responsive to the voters.

855,"Go read what Orwell wrote about it. He was a democratic socialist, and is famous for his ability to articulate complex material clearly. 

I'm old. Over the period *I* have been paying attention, the Democratic party has done nothing but move right on economic issues. The *republican* party included staunch support of labor unions and workers rights (including equal rights and pay for minorities and women) until the 70s. *Nixon* ran on a platform that included investigating whether a 30 hour work week with no loss in wages would increase employment. *Reagan* made the first gestures toward what could be described as a minimum basic income (EITC). I was against both on social (and corruption) issues, but Nixon was to the left of Hillary on economic policies. Our country broadly agreed on leftist economic policies, and differed only on the social policies. Now we broadly agree on rightist economic policies and differ only on the social policies, vague nods in the current election season notwithstanding. "

I don't remember Republicans *ever* supporting labor unions. I found this on wikipedia:

> Since the 1920s Republicans have generally been opposed by labor union organizations and members. At the national level Republicans supported the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions. Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various ""right to work"" laws that weaken unions.

Can you elucidate please?

From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon_presidential_campaign,_1968):

Let's take a look at the only candidate who claims to be a [Democratic Socialist](https://berniesanders.com/democratic-socialism-in-the-united-states/) in the race.
"
863,"I actually looked up the R party platforms from 1936-1968 a while back. Here are some excerpts (re labor and healthcare, which was responsive to the OP):

R platform of 1936--Support the adoption of state laws and interstate compacts to abolish sweatshops and child labor, and to protect women and children with respect to maximum hours, minimum wages and working conditions. We believe that this can be done within the Constitution as it now stands.

1940--We shall maintain labor's right of free organization and collective bargaining. We pledge that our American citizens of Negro descent shall be given a square deal in the economic and political life of this nation. We favor the extension of necessary old age benefits on an ear-marked pay-as-you-go basis to the extent that the revenues raised for this purpose will permit. We favor the extension of the unemployment compensation provisions of the Social Security Act, wherever practicable, to those groups and classes not now included.

1944--The Republican Party accepts the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act, the Wage and Hour Act, the Social Security Act and all other Federal statutes designed to promote and protect the welfare of American working men and women, and we promise a fair and just administration of these laws.

1948--There must be decent living at decent wages. We favor equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.

1952--Still pro-union, pro-racial and gender equality, pro extending SS to all. First mention of healthcare: We are opposed to Federal compulsory health insurance with its crushing cost, wasteful inefficiency, bureaucratic dead weight, and debased standards of medical care. We shall support those health activities by government which stimulate the development of adequate hospital services without Federal interference in local administration. We favor support of scientific research. We pledge our continuous encouragement of improved methods of assuring health protection.

1956--Extend the protection of the Federal minimum wage laws to as many more workers as is possible and practicable; Continue to fight for the elimination of discrimination in employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry or sex; Provide assistance to improve the economic conditions of areas faced with persistent and substantial unemployment; Revise and improve the Taft-Hartley Act so as to protect more effectively the rights of labor unions, management, the individual worker, and the public. The protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration. Republican action created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. We have fully resolved to continue our steady gains in man's unending struggle against disease and disability. We have supported the distribution of free vaccine to protect millions of children against dreaded polio. Republican leadership has enlarged Federal assistance for construction of hospitals, emphasizing low-cost care of chronic diseases and the special problems of older persons, and increased Federal aid for medical care of the needy. We have asked the largest increase in research funds ever sought in one year to intensify attacks on cancer, mental illness, heart disease and other dread diseases. We demand once again, despite the reluctance of the Democrat 84th Congress, Federal assistance to help build facilities to train more physicians and scientists.

1960--Relating wage and other payments in production to productivity—except when necessary to correct inequalities—in order to help us stay competitive at home and abroad. Spurring the economy by advancing the successful Eisenhower-Nixon program fostering new and small business, by continued active enforcement of the anti-trust laws, by protecting consumers and investors against the hazard and economic waste of fraudulent and criminal practices in the market place. Republican action has given to millions of American working men and women new or expanded protection and benefits, such as: Increased federal minimum wage; Development of a health program that will provide the aged needing it, on a sound fiscal basis and through a contributory system, protection against burdensome costs of health care. Such a program should: Provide the beneficiaries with the option of purchasing private health insurance;Include state participation; A single, federal assistance grant to each state for aid to needy persons rather than dividing such grants into specific categories.

1964--Start to sound a bit more like Rs, but advocate: full coverage of all medical and hospital costs for the needy elderly people, financed by general revenues through broader implementation of Federal-State plans, rather than the compulsory Democratic scheme covering only a small percentage of such costs, for everyone regardless of need; tax credits for those burdened by the expenses of college education; full implementation and faithful execution of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other civil rights statutes, to assure equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution to every citizen;

1968--Organized labor has contributed greatly to the economic strength of our country and the well-being of its members. The Republican Party vigorously endorses its key role in our national life. We support an equitable minimum wage for American workers—one providing fair wages without unduly increasing unemployment among those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder—and will improve the Fair Labor Standards Act, with its important protections for employees. The forty-hour week adopted 30 years ago needs re-examination to determine whether or not a shorter work week, without loss of wages, would produce more jobs, increase productivity and stabilize prices.

Which we already do.  Mandatory background checks for purchase of any gun from an FFL.  Automatic weapons, short barreled weapons and suppressors are highly regulated, requiring extensive background checks and registered along with $200 tax stamps.

What happened in Dallas was a horrible tragedy. The deaths of those men destroyed the lives of so many people; their families, friends, co-workers. Coincidentally I read that last month the Department lost 50 officers to better paying positions or other reasons. I imagine they feel under assault from all sides. It's a terrible time.

The disproportionate level of deaths by the hand of police is also a horrible tragedy. There are deep problems related to training, militarization and professionalism across the country. These systemic issues have destroyed a much high number of lives and families in the community. The culture must change and that change must be driven by leadership and by example. We're seeing the leadership is still floundering and and as a result, change is not yet possible.

Despite terrible the end result, I respect the right of people to obtain weapons and engage when justice is not being served. No one is treated equally and people are abused every day. Every person is just a meat bag like any other and when one group of meatbags keeps killing another group, it would be cruel to restrict weapons to only one group. Try to consider the complexities of morals, rights, and the struggle of human nature and realize that removing a gun from the equation isn't really relevant to the topic - just a distraction from the real problems that the leadership is unable and/or unwilling to address.

1022,Thank you Rick Scott
1023,Except pretty much every other poll has said that she still has the lead in Florida and virtually every other swing state.

1028,This will go over well 
1029,That would explain the freakin 10 commercials a day telling me how wonderful Clinton is because she has always been there for the children.
1030,He will be leading her very soon.
1031,">according to a poll released Monday by a group tied to Gov. Rick Scott.

By a pollster that gets a C from 538, with a +1.1 republican bias."
1032,"But you don't understand! All those other polls are skewed!

Where's ""unskewedpolls.com"" when you need them?"
1033,"But when other polls over sample Democrats and under sample Republicans and independents, Clintonistas celebrate the news. "
1034,Not really true. It's been very close. 
1035,Every poll does that.
1036,"In Florida, this means that the question is phrased:  ""If the election were held today and the tube wasn't showing Jag of Matlock reruns , who would you vote for president?"" "
1037,They obviously unskewed it to show Trump leading. 
1038,"From a Republican pollster means that they assume voting demographics will resemble a mid-term electorate, fortunately it's far more likely that the electorate will look like it did in 2012 with a slight uptick in Hispanic voters. "

1048,I don't know enough about political polling to dispute that. I will reiterate that I am interested to see the details behind it though. 
1049,Just a tweak here and a little push there and poof: we've got the results we believe in!
1050,lol @ thinking most Americans are excited enough for lackluster Hillary to turn out in numbers. That's a pipe dream. She won't drive turnout. We're going to have historic low turnout everywhere.

1057,"Donald Trump is definitely going to increase turnout for Hispanics to a historic level. 

We've already seen Colorado turn from a Republican to a Democratic plurality of registrations.  "
1058,My argument would be that if she doesn't take OH it would be indicative of the rest of the rust belt.  Throw in losing Florida and it's getting bleak for her.  My two cents.  No sense arguing hypotheticals past a certain point though 
1059,See one of my prior comments.  I.e. if she is vulnerable in OH she is going to have a problem in the rust belt. And in that list if she loses PA she loses.  Which is very possible.  You're throwing a lot of ifs out there and I said before it's pointless to argue hypotheticals past a certain point. This email shit was the last thing she needed.  
1060,"Might as well call the race in July then if she's already ""solidly at 210"" /s"
1061,"Um...Didn't Trump pull even with Clinton in the polls about a month ago, only to find himself down five points today?"
1062,Aaaaand that's false. You only have to look at polls aggregator to know it. 
1063,"Yeah but then he said there was voter fraud or something, so still out of touch with reality."
1064,[Party identification](http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/political-attitudes/party-identification/) is somewhere between +6 and +9 to the D's vs the R's. That ought to be common knowledge around here by now.
1065,This is virtually identical to the skewed polls strategy. It doesn't work. 
1066,"Ah, relying on your opponent to drive your own base to the polls. What a sound strategy! XD"
1067,"Eh, Ohio has always been more of a swing state than PA or definitely MI. Trump could theoretically pull of a close win in OH, and still lose MI and tight in MI. I just don't see how he wins in FL with out turning around his campaign in a big way nationwide. But like you said, it's hypothetical map building at this point."
1068,"Even in 2000 and 2004 the Democrat won all those states except OH and IN.

Indiana is never really in play. Also the only way Hill loses PA is if Pittsburgh votes Trump. I just don't see it.

So I just do not get this trouble in the rust belt idea.


"
1069,Well there are states that are extremely predictable. Its not like the pollsters are saying Alabama is going for Clinton.
1070,Actually voting difference is lower. 
1071,"I know, I failed to clarify that my plus or minus numbers were based on party identification.   If dems are identifying as 31% of population,  they are being sampled as 35% and repubs 28% vs 24% in polling. "
1072,Hillary really didn't have a problem getting African Americans and Hispanic Americans to vote for her in the primary and that was when she was running against an adorable old socialist who didn't have a racist bone in his body. 
1073,"Exactly.  Just map building.  As far as FL is concerned, I think people underestimate how many Hispanics there will vote for him.  Remember, many there are Cuban, and are there because they fled communism.  Just something to think about.  "
1074,Sure.  That was twelve years ago.  The working class there is angry and frankly very possibly ready to vote against the status quo.  I live in NJ close to the PA border and it's sounding like a very real possibility there at this point.  We'll see what happens.  This email shit didn't help.  
1075,"Pennsylvania is the state that has moved right the hardest in the last 12 years.  You don't realize it because Obama had big wins, but it has been less and less D leaning each election."
1076,"Party ID makeup in 2012 was [38 percent Democratic, 32 percent Republican and 29 percent Independent.](http://www.businessinsider.com/exit-polls-election-obama-vs-romney-youth-latino-black-catholic-sampling-2012-11)

1079,"Thank you for sourcing your assertion.   Appreciated.  Still though, if 40% of Cubans in Florida are voting red it points to a trump win there in all factuality.  It is what it is.  We'll see what happens. "
1080,"This isn't even based on a poll. It's some social media sentiment analysis that's not even based on likely or registered voters and just tracks posts on social media platforms as ""positive / negative / neutral"" "

1084,"Obviously this is nonsense. The Republican share of the vote since 1960 is based on voting numbers, this ""survey of digital discussions"" has no relation to voting intentions (or anything resembling reality I'd wager). 

There is in fact a whole industry that conducts reputable polls of voting intentions, last I heard Donald was at an astounding 1% among African Americans which if holds true to November would be about the lowest percentage of the African American vote since George Wallace. "

We could go on and on, but if you simply look at his actions and his speeches, it is utter madness to call him Christian, or a follower in Jesus (a Jew) in any way.

I see. So your citation is your own circular logic then. (Technically, this is what is known as the No True Scotsman Fallacy.)

This is the same as someone saying they are a vegetarian, but eating a bunch of hamburgers behind closed doors. People say a lot of things, and religion is a powerful tool to the charismatic to control others, but it is our actions, not our statements, that defines who we are. 

Hitler was basically the exact opposite of who Jesus was, and his messages were the complete opposite. He can say all day long that he was doing it in Jesus's name or for the good of the people, but in reality he's as close to a demon as a man can become.

1182,"I don't think it was a waste of resources for the FBI to investigate Clinton. Her private server opened the possibility of national security being breached. Whether or not it happened, because she opened the possibility to it, it was worth the time to investigate. "
1183,That is REALLY not true.  I hate to break it to you but I ran the indoc classes at a SCIF.  More than a few people ended up in Ft.  Leavenworth because of an innocent fuck up when it came to classified materials.   Showing No Intent.. just carelessness.  
1184,I know the candidate I like will win because everyone I know will vote for them!
1185,"> Also she was not within her rights to delete personal emails from an account that she used for work.

You're wrong there. Show me where that's illegal. Once you understand she was allowed to sort out her personal correspondence we can proceed. I suggest you google something like ""hillary deleting personal emails"" and find some reputable sources. 

Ok. Ready? No need to apologize. You just did not know. Now you do, right. 

On to your next point:

I'm not forgetting the emails her legal team deleted. They should have used a better method, no doubt. But I've known that keyword based exclusion/inclusion is a pretty standard method for sorting through large document stores for the purpose of legal discovery for long before the Clinton email gate so it doesn't seem at all unusual to me. How would you have done it. You've got 60k documents. What method do you use to remove personal ones?  Go back and review your lesson on personal correspondence before you answer if it will help. No need to lose credibility by posting again from ignorance. "
1186,There's a scare story they tell us during one of those security clearence classes that Hillary skipped. This kid was gave the undercover dude a field manual and he got convicted of being a traitor.
1187,Bullshit.   NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD BRING THIS CASE because in the last 99 years the FBI said only one other person has been charged with it and it involved an espionage case with a plea bargain and that the consitutionality of the law itself is in question.
1188,Generic cop compliment Brian!
1189,"Actually I'm not wrong you need to go look at the Rules and Regs lain out by the NARA.  
________________
*""Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.""*
___________
  That makes it awfully clear that it is up the that agency to determine what constitutes a federal record.  Not the email recipient, not the email sender. 

 So when you are using a personal email system for official business, you don't get to decide what emails are non-work related.  Someone else at the agency that employs you does that - In this case the State Dept.


And since you brought up her legal team.. none of them had the requisite clearance required to go through her emails in the first place, so she delivered classified materials to people who were not authorized to view them.   

And that group of people subsequently destroyed classified materials without authorization from the classifying agency. "
1190,"No actually quite a few people have been charged with the same crime.. and in his testimony before Congress,  Comey talked about 4 different ones since he has been director of the FBI"
1191,"SoS is a cabinet level appointee not an employee. She is literally the head of the big ""D""  gov't department as indicated by her eponymous title. You are quoting some best practices document or at best a directive. Learn the basics: the server itself is not a problem. Mixing work and personal, political emails, not a problem. Deleting personal emails not a problem. The issue was whether she knowingly spilled secret stuff into non secret stuff or knowingly deleted SoS related stuff and, naturally anything Comey's team, The FBI, could come up with during their extended fishing expedition. 

Bottom line: A republican leaning cop who'd spent part of his early career hunting Clinton, spent a year, as head of the FBI, trying to find something to take Clinton down with and all he came up with were potential administrative sanctions and a 10 minute personal manifesto trying to hurt her this campaign season. 

That does not pass muster given the hoopla and wild accusations that have been thrown around. It's shameful."

1193,"Nope. You're making stuff up. you're advancing a counter narrative, Agent 000.  You're comparing a cabinet level appointee to a CEO. That is not how it works. Argue with Comey over this and not me, but your analogy is shit. So, no, A presidential appointee is not necessarily bound by your google search. 

>And those were not MY RULES.. they were THE RULES

these are evidently your dim impressions of the laws, directives and guidelines levied against you in whatever secret squirrel position you're claiming to have held. 

The secretary of state does not work at your SCIF. In your terms, she is a walking SCIF. Ask yourself in a sober moment, how else could she do her job? 

>. AND I used to run the Indocs at my SCIF. That is were we give classes to people to tell them how to handle classified material, and what the penalties are for messing up. 

Ok. Ask yourself this. Do they give soldiers all of the five star general classes during your short indoctrination to whatever the fuck you claim you did?

So assuming that this article is correct, that he has not filed that paperwork yet, it seems as though it's not set in stone that he will be Trumps VP."
1317,He was never going to choose Pence.  This is just an easy way to take another swipe at media credibility.  When they quote anonymous sources or other media outlets they need to be chastised.

>Pence is running for re-election, but Indiana law prevents him from seeking two offices at once. He faces a Friday deadline to withdraw from the governor's race. The paperwork has been drawn up for him to take that step, according to a Republican, who insisted on anonymity because that person was not authorized to publicly discuss the plans. However, those documents have not been filed."

And I really don't get this faith in Trump's abilities. The guy is winging it and more often than not, it bites him in the ass."

We don't celebrate Malcom X day and the only Indian historical figure we can name is gandhi and we're lucky to spell it correctly. All it could possibly do is raise awareness.

1422,">Clearly there has been a shift towards Trump over the past few weeks, and will likely continue into he GOP convention.

Actually untrue -- there's been a shift *away* from Clinton, and to Stein and Johnson.  Trump has barely gained any voters, even as Clinton's been pummeled in the press the last few weeks.  It's not good for Clinton for her favorables and trustworthiness numbers to tank, but it's not favorable for Trump for him not to really benefit, because it'll be easier for Clinton to pry voters back from third party candidates than if they'd gone to the other major candidate."
1423,"> Clearly there has been a shift towards Trump over the past few weeks, and will likely continue into he GOP convention.

Not if you look at the NBC/Marist polls that came out today.  They show Trump down by *a lot* in the key swing states.

Fracking has allowed natural gas to supplant coal in the United States, which is a huge net positive.  Natural gas has about half the emissions of coal.  If you burned more coal and less natural gas, you would be adding more GHGs to the atmosphere."
1462,"That's gotta be just about the stupidest reasoning for supporting fracking, while completely missing the whole point."
1463,"> The ironic thing is that banning fracking wouldn't be good for the environment.

Ironic as in ""untrue""? In reality the reduction in greenhouse gases is marginal when you consider the methane released in the extraction process, and pollution due to fracking chemicals is currently not well understood. Renewable energy is a much cleaner, safer and soon to be cheaper alternative."
1464,Isn't the point of banning fracking to improve the environment?
1465,"Well, if you ban fracking, the electric power replacement will not be renewable energy, it will be coal.  I think that's obvious.  You can't build a new renewable energy capacity overnight, but you can burn more coal.  

Coal mining is also even worse for the environment than fracking is the pollution from extraction is no great shakes either.

As for methane, when it comes to GHGs, C02 is the real problem.  When you release C02, it has a long-term affect.  Methane doesn't stay in the atmosphere over the long-term."
1466,"That's ridiculously over-simplified and wrong. Fracking is just an extraction method. If you ban it it doesn't shut down the existing producing wells. And we currently have a major supply glut. And coal is no longer economically feasible, even without a carbon tax. Renewables are the future. Don't fall for the political talking points."
1467,"> And coal is no longer economically feasible

But coal is economically infeasible because of fracked gas. Eliminating fracking will reduce the productivity of new wells which will drive down supply, driving up cost and improving the economics of coal."
1468,"Wind is now cheaper than coal, and solar too if you include carbon capture. And it's no contest at all if you factor in the environmental and public health cost of coal. And eliminating fracking won't magically erase the current supply glut of gas."
1469,"I suppose I should have quoted your entire sentence (emphasis mine):

> And coal is no longer economically feasible, *even without a carbon tax*. 

Why would anyone include carbon capture?

And I haven't even touched on capacity: wind doesn't provide capacity since it isn't dispatched. Coal *destroys* wind on price if we have to add energy storage. 

Banning fracking means helping the economics of coal."

Have you ever read Emile Durkheim?

Basically, even though he was personally pretty far left, his theory had some interesting conservative undertones.

1574,"Removing classified information from its proper place.  Others (even Comey) have quoted the statues.  But let me give you my basis.

I have a very old top secret clearance.  It was made very clear to us that we had to protect classified information, as well as operational information.   In the latter case at TI, we had to treat as classified copies of Aviation Week if we took them into a secured area.  Because what we were doing was often more clearly discussed there, and spies could possibly glean what we were doing from creases (indicating our interest) on articles.  

I could give many other examples.  But as a lowly engineer out of college, it was clear I couldn't handle classified information, or even hold discussions about meta information about classified information outside secure facilities.

That Hillary constructed a system to manage her own communications, where anyone might send classified information. But even operational information should not be exchanged outside approved governmental systems (no matter what flaws said systems have).  That Clinton did, and edited and p provided only constructed versions to the state department... this in and of itself demonstrate purposeful intent to subvert security and accountability.  And that she and those at the state department allowed this to continue should be investigated and prosecuted.

We would have been fired, and likely prosecuted for leaving a printer ribbon in a printer when allowing it to be serviced by non-cleared (but holding secret clearance) personnel while escorted. This was because those printers had been used to print top secret documents, even though the ribbon was a loop and the ribbon cycled and was reused over time, obscuring any pattern of print.

Hillary gave full and direct access to as many as 10 uncleared personnel to her communications, devices, and servers.

The defense the FBI gave is that Hillary neither understood classified information, nor how it should be protected.  But o can't see how she (and those around her) could fail to understand that classified information cannot be managed on personal systems.  Yet this is what the designed, implemented, and what they persisted on doing even when these systems failed when filtered by the legitimate systems."
1575,"The only investigatory body made a very careful slight of hand with verbiage to call the behavior of Clinton and her staff anything but negligent while hammering the point that she didn't intend to commit a crime. 

They did this specifically to duck 793(f).

Everyone in the intelligence communities is familiar with 793(f) because it's the great boogeyman of mishandling classified information, regardless of intent. The fact that Clinton wasn't charged under 793(f) showed everyone that a two track justice system really does exist. James Comey, without question to anyone familiar with the statute, laid out that Clinton was in violation of 793(f). But since she didn't intend to harm National Security (allegedly) no one would prosecute her for it.

The problem with that is that intent isn't required under 793(f) only negligence, which there was evidence of in abundance, just relabeled as carelessness. During his hearings I was shocked that no one asked Director Comey what, specifically, stopped him from recommending an indictment on the basis of 793(f)."

What you can not seem to face is that there is broad support in this country for republicans, and by proxy conservativism.  You dont like that, too fucking bad.  There are plenty of conservatives who hate progressives and apologists.  Either something is going to have to give in order to bring the two sides together, or the partisan game is only going to get worse...

Thinking that conservatives are going to simply get old and die off and then things will get better is ludicrous.  Those people have descendants, and they do not easily forget.  This war will rage for decades, if not centuries."
1577,"Exactly.  There is really no other way to equalize the problems between the different factions of people in this nation.  In the end, people are just going to have to fight it out, and let the best one win.  

Do you honestly see either side of the political spectrum compromising with the other?  Show me proof of that movement.  I see nothing bringing the two sides together except conflict.  I see us growing further and further apart, regardless of who started it, or who is being reasonable or unreasonable.  You can not shame people into submission, only will you force them into the shadows, just waiting for a chance to strike back.  

Do you really think that you can legislate hate or racism away?  No... you can not legislate thought, and by publicly shaming people in an effort to force social change, it only pisses them off...and sooner or later it will come to blows.  Thats just the way I see it.

Why would I argue with the FBI? They agree with me, not you. There's no strict liability offense related to Clinton's activity; you need to have some kind of mens rea. ""Extreme carelessness"" isn't a legal standard in the field of criminal law, and ""intentional carelessness"" (or its actual legal relation: ""wilfulness"") isn't what they found."

1610,"Well, that's exactly my point.  I can't see how they came to the conclusion she set up her own email server by ""accident"", and unknowingly used her own server for her entire term, and she and everyone around her didn't understand communications need to be secure, and she and everyone around her didn't know that communication systems need to be vetted and approved.

The idea that her communications could be safely unsecure isn't even consistant with her own statememts about ""the personal"".  Clearly she understood the need to keep her own emails secure;  one must assume even an ""unsophistcated"" user like Hillary knew the same applied to State Department emails.

All the facts the FBI uncovered demonstrate she knew she was setting up her own communications, she insisted on this set up, that Hillary and those around her knew they were skirting the rules for communications, that those around Hillary knew that Hillary should be using a State department email.

The defense that others did similar things isn't a defense.  Maybe an argument that more should be investigated, and maybe charged.  Not a defense.

[Trump] hired mobbed-up firms to erect Trump Tower and his Trump Plaza apartment building in Manhattan, including buying ostensibly overpriced concrete from a company controlled by mafia chieftains Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno and Paul Castellano. That story eventually came out in a federal investigation, which also concluded that in a construction industry saturated with mob influence, the Trump Plaza apartment building most likely benefited from connections to racketeering. Trump also failed to disclose that he was under investigation by a grand jury directed by the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn... In all, I’ve covered Donald Trump off and on for 27 years, and in that time I’ve encountered multiple threads linking Trump to organized crime....No other candidate for the White House this year has anything close to Trump’s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters, swindlers, and other crooks. Professor Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, said the closest historical example would be President Warren G. Harding and Teapot Dome, a bribery and bid-rigging scandal in which the interior secretary went to prison."

By not going to the convention and not losing by delegate vote count conceding or endorsing Clinton before the convention has even begun ruined his credibility and lost a chance to show the public how the selection process works at a convention, the last step in the candidate selection process.

Real estate investor and former billionaire TOM BARRACK told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday that he’s raised $32 million in contributions toward a super PAC backing presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump...Barrack’s announcement follows a Wall Street Journal report earlier this week that CASINO BILLIONAIRE SHELDON ADELSON is also looking to start a super PAC supporting the controversial GOP front-runner...In addition to the dollars flowing in from super PACs, Trump has also garnered vocal support from other current and former billionaires. Investment activist CARL ICAHN said that electing Trump into the White House is “a no-brainer.” Icahn has supported Trump throughout the campaign. Meanwhile, former oil BILLIONAIRE T. BOONE PICKENS, who originally backed Florida Governor Jeb Bush (and gave $100,000 toward a Bush PAC in February of 2015), told participants at an economic conference in Las Vegas last month that he is now in favor of a Trump presidency. Fellow real estate and casino TYCOON PHIL RUFFIN, who co-owns the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Las Vegas with Trump, has also publicly endorsed him.

1733,Really? What case is she currently hearing involving Trump?
1734,Yes.  That is what we are saying.  They can hold opinions but they can't express them because then bias is apprehended.  Imagine if we get another Bush/Gore scenario and hers is the vote that gives it to Clinton. 
1735,"What does that have to do with her flushing her impartiality down the toilet? Justices don't act like this for a reason. Seriously, if this is how the Court is going to act then why even have one? "
1736,"But that vote was never supposed to be about preference. It was supposed to be about Law. This is exactly what Trump got into trouble for. Saying that his judge is ""Mexican"". As if that gives him a bias. And others then found that he was part of a Latino group. None of that ""should"" matter. Their job is to follow Law. Not their personal opinion. I'm not saying that you're wrong. But it's crazy to think that all of them don't have opinions. But we choose them to ignore those and just rule based on Law."

What technique are you referring to here?"
1741,I'll give you that. And she may have to recuse herself if something like Election 2000 happens again. But most matters handed to the Supreme Court have little to do with the sitting president.

They miss out that with AR games like Pokemon Go and Ingress, that the games are actually doing more for local economies than games have in a very long time.

For example, if you spend a warm sunny saturday wandering around your local city, exploring and finding a new bunch of pokemon to add to your collection, there is a good chance that you will also be spending money at businesses along the way.

For myself, when I go for photo walks, which I am guessing will include some pokemon catching, I usually stop for coffee 2-3 times, and at least one meal. 

Traditionally games have been played indoors and stationary. With the parts of the hardware coming from outside, as well as the game itself.

A white supremacist cop, handed a badge and a gun and empowered to enforce our already racialized, classist, ableist laws, is a clear and present danger. Or in this case, was. Unlike someone who chooses to be a white supremacist, criminal records—the typical subject raised by media in efforts to dehumanize victims of police violence—stem from a lot of things; not the least of which being the racialized legacy of policing, housing, access to employment, loans, and education, the racialized nature of the war on drugs, the cyclical nature of poverty, recidivism, and a host of other things often outside one’s individual control.

I don't think you understand the realities of tuition and job opportunities and pay. 

1. When I went to college, $10,000 covered all 4 years at state. Today, tuition is more than $10,000 a year - not including room and board and books.

2. There were jobs back then that a college kid could get and it paid enough to pay for at least one semester of tuition.   My local McDonald's that pays $8/hour (today) wants people who are bi-lingual in English and Spanish.  The are mostly staffed by Hispanics.

3. I made $5.15 an hour back in 1987 while in college. That's $11 an hour these days. Good luck getting that.


Compared to kids today, I had it easy. 

And the job market for new grads sucks.  I didn't have to worry about off-shoring or H1-b visa holders. 
These kids do.

That's what older folks don't understand, things have changed dramatically.

Back when my Dad went to college, you could get a degree *in anything* and there was a job for you. Because back then not many people went to college because there were  plenty of opportunities else where. 


Our standard of living is declining for most of us."
1894,[deleted]
1895,"[Average in state college tuition is roughly $9000 a year](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/2015-16-state-tuition-and-fees-public-four-year-institutions-state-and-five-year-percentage) for a 4 year college, not including room and board, textbooks, meal plans, etc.  

If I worked 20 hrs a week making $8.50/hr (reasonable for someone with only a high school diploma) and paid no income tax that would almost pay for tuition, but there would be no money left over for any other expenses.  

Point being, ""get a job you free loader"" is not a viable option.  

So the options are either don't go to college until you save enough money or take out a loan through a private institution at a much higher interest rate than the feds currently offer.  

Basically, if you're poor, tough luck kiddo.

1939,Here here
1940,"He thinks that, and it's true. You see, it's part of Make America Great Again, too. ""Great"" is more than status. It's trajectory. The world is coming *from* slavery, *from* warring against our neighbors, *from* uncertainty, *from* all men being subject to unjust rulers. 

The American trajectory has been the expansion of freedom, individual liberty, the ideas of brotherhood and equal rights. It's always had it's eyes ahead, trying to find new ways to make people more free, more prosperous, more independent, to carry the banner for equality among men for the entire world. 

Multicultural thought, cultural relativism throws those ideas aside. It basically says if you believe something hard enough, it's just as valid as these great ideas that have increasingly benefited more and more people. And that's just not true. We do better when we minimize our differences and **all agree on a singular American ideal**. That's the kind of thinking that people learn in even the most basic group experiments: groups that set their differences aside, even their own beliefs aside, and accept a singular notion and work toward it will be more successful as a group.

So in the end, what made America great wasn't status, it was trajectory. We knew, with certainty, that things were going to get better for everyone as Americans. People who latch on to things that happened historically to claim some fundamental harm are diminishing that trajectory."

OK."
1950,"Clearly you need to look farther than your false right wing propaganda sources.  Here is the definition for you (although I love that you are admitting right wingers are the racists at least)

Dog-whistle politics is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The phrase is often used as a pejorative because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently distasteful to the general populace. The analogy is to a dog whistle, whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

1954,"American greatness is about trajectory. Before segregation, we had worse, slavery.

During slavery, only whites had democratic political power. But before white citizens had political power? No one but a king had political power.

Before a king had political power? We had worse, might made right and people had no ability to peaceful living (man at war with man). 

If you can agree that segregation was better than slavery, and that slavery of some was better than slavery for all, and that slavery for all was better than constant death and destruction, you are starting to get it. It's about trajectory.

It's our job to find ways to promote a trajectory of freedom for Americans. When you find that trajectory, America will start becoming great again. You won't find it if everyone is constantly complaining about their tribal grievances."
1955,"Once again, it's about trajectory. More people could aspire to the American ideal by 1900 than could in 1800. After the end of segregation, even more legal barriers to individual liberty were gone. We've consistently gained more and more people on the train of the American ideal over the years. Only recently have people started to attack the American ideal and act like the American experiment is somehow evil just because it necessarily came from a time worse than now. 

And a side note: 'progressives' didn't end slavery, or build society, or rail against unjust rule. Classical liberals did. They believed that man had a right to determine his own outcomes, succeed or fail. Modern 'Progressives' want to control outcomes."

2031,"Google trump rapes.  There is his exwife, the la lawsuit that was dismissed on a very odd technicality that has since been refiled in new york.   
Find the witness testimony regarding the thirteen year old if you want to vomit"
2032,Source?
2033,Consensually
2034,He comes across as a guy who would rape
2035,"Why should there be outrage on either side?  They're still human beings, they're still allowed to have an opinion.  Joining the Supreme Court isn't joining the Night's Watch, you don't have to renounce all past allegiances."
2036,So he was never convicted? 
2037,"You want me to give you a source that proves ""raping isn't cool""?

It's basic morality that should tell you that."
2038,"The fact is, there wasn't outrage. That Republicans are now clamoring over her comments is completely disgusting. I don't have an issue with her making political comments. I do have an issue with her being attacked for it, while the traditionally conservative justices who were political escape the criticism. None of the Republicans criticizing have brought up Thomas or Scalia."
2039,Neither was Hillary.  Or Bill for that matter.  So since that's our new threshold let's all stop talking about their alleged transgressions as well.
2040,Neither was Hillary.  Or Bill for that matter.  So since that's our new threshold let's all stop talking about their alleged transgressions as well.
2041,Trump has bribed his way out of court cases. Since he has already proven that he is willing to corrupt the system: convictions are not evidence of innocence in his case. 
2042,"The Clinton's haven't been convicted of anything either, do you think they're innocent too?"
2043,Don't be silly. A source indicating that he was convicted of rape
2044,You didn't answer my question
2045,I haven't seen enough evidence to say one way or the other
2046,"I think we need proof, not just innuendo or lawsuits yet to be proven..."
2047,Dyzo is a notorious anti-trump troll. There is no source
2048,"Hey, you're the guy from the other thread who likes to use derogatory terms to dehumanize minority groups, right? "
2049,yes i did. Convictions are irrelevant if a person bribes the courts
2050,"What derogatory term have I used to dehumanize minorities? Also nice deflection, at least we determined you don't have a source for your claim"

2076,Clinton has bribed top United States officials. People in office took oaths to uphold the law. The Law has shown that it does not apply evenly to people. This shows us that the government has become a tyranny. If you watch Loretta Lynch's testimony it is clear that she refuses to answer any questions given to her from congress.
2077,"See, I don't know or think that Clinton has bribed anyone.  No, I think collectively her and her supporters fight for their ideals instinctively and have no need to be bribed into supporting her for President;  they know the culture and power shift that will happen under Trump. "

2081,I think Hillary should just run with 'extremely careless' because the alternative is far worse 
2082,"Absolutely.

It's impossible that Clinton carelessly hired a White House IT to carelessly set up an unsecured private email server in her house in secret from the State Department in order to carelessly maintain communication with a close friend otherwise forbidden to work for the State Department and carelessly pay for his services out of a charitable front while carelessly advising her aides to change Classified markings on documents to allow them to be carelessly distributed on her unsecured server.

No, none of that is careless.

It's fucking *deliberate.*"
2083," From 1996 to 1998, he served as a special counsel to President Bill Clinton, 

Davis went on to receive his law degree from Yale Law School in 1970. It was there that he first met Hillary Rodham Clinton

an email from davis to Hillary:
“The honest to goodness truth is: Aside from [wife] Carolyn, my four children, and my immediate family, I consider you to be the best friend and the best person I have met in my long life,” Mr. Davis wrote Mrs. Clinton in an email asking her to talk to a reporter on his behalf. “You know that from the dedication and appreciation of you I have always felt and expressed to you over four decades. So that is why your comments would mean a lot to me, even if just a written statement.”

Mrs. Clinton responded she’d have one of her top liaisons at State, Cheryl Mills, check with an ethics lawyers and get back to him with an answer.


But just a day later, Mr. Davis decided to retract his request for a favor. The reason?

After thinking about it, the experienced crisis manager decided it might not look so good for a Cabinet officer to be vouching for a registered foreign agent whose clients over the years have hailed from such controversial locations as Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Honduras.

“As soon as I wrote last email, I reverted to my old role as your crisis manager and worrier about you, read the word ‘optics’ I suddenly felt – oops,” Mr. Davis wrote. “I am registered under FARA for one or more foreign governments or businesses. I don’t think it would look right. I want to avoid any even slight chance of misperception. So let’s not chance it.”
"
2084,"Then her actions were deliberate. 

The feds have spoken. She is either incompetent or a criminal.

The feds decided, despite the evidence being there for criminal acts,  she was just ""recklessly careless"".

And even though this, according to the English dictionary is another way of saying grossly negligent, which is also a crime btw, decided for some reason  not to charge her "
2085,"Yes, it was fair calculated."
2086,"Said the guy who called HRC [""my best friend and the best person I have met in my long life.""](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/09/02/kissing-what-student-influence-can-learn-from-clinton-emails/ikawInLEYHeyRHv1lAdYTI/story.html)"
2087,So apparently today's obfuscation is: Hillary is not responsible for ignoring her own directive because it was her subordinates' job to make her do the right thing. 
2088,"Buddy, You only have two choices here

- FBI was correct Hillary didnt understand what she was doing and was completely careless

- FBI was wrong she knew exactly what she was doing and did it with intention. 

You have to pick one and if you pick the second options its time to go back to the FBI with this new information."
2089,"There was nothing careless about ""mistakes"" she made. Every single one of them was a calculated decision. It's a shame that money buys protection."
2090,You're right. It was beyond that.
2091,Comey strongly hinted at her being so phenomenally unsophisticated she wasn't even able to understand she was doing anything wrong in the first place. It's still the mission of his office to recommend an indictment in this case but I find the idea of the FBI director suggesting Hillary being downright fucking developmentally challenged rather amusing.
2092,[deleted]
2093,"Yeah, not biased at all."
2094,"How does the English dictionary define ""desperation""?"
2095,"You think the Secretary of State intentionally and knowingly tried to compromise U.S. security? Come on, give me a break. Extreme carelessness is an apt description. "
2096,"The head of the FBI essentially said Hillary is too retarded to indict.

And yet there are people supporting this woman."
2097,"> she will never realize when this strategy has passed its use-by date.


Let's hope so. American's need to reject her corruption in November. "
2098,"not at all, just like AG Lynch"
2099,"""The naive belief that Hillary Clinton gives a shit about her supporters."""
2100,With Clinton I do.
2101,"I cant stand the woman but i agree that she didn't do it with any sort of malice. I think she was mostly trying to keep her emails off the books so they couldn't become fodder later on. She was putting her own political needs before anything else, including national security. If anything was compromised it was more of an unintended side effect than a deliberate outcome. Now, that doesn't mean i don't think that she should face some consequences for it. A fuck up is still a fuck up, regardless of her intentions. Comey basically said there wasn't enough evidence to prove criminal intent, but that there should be some sort of recourse. Its just not his job to determine those sorts of actions, and unfortunately she no longer holds office right now. So the government is limited on what they can do to her without more evidence. "
2102,Gross negligence is a better description.
2103,"he also took it upon himself to invalidate a law from 1917 that says intent does not matter and cites ""gross negligence"" as the determining factor.  "
2104,Trickle down needs to step it up.
2105,"Unsurprising. The U.S. is one of the least taxed nations in the OECD. We're 31/34 for tax revenue as percentage of GDP, 17/34 for corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP, and 19/34 for tax revenue per capita.

2106,That's worrying information. I wonder if they even factored in costs from rising climate and potentially social instability as well? This number could end up being even higher than 122%.
2107,It's not pointless to fight for what you believe in.  Please stop fearmongering in attempt to gain support for Hillary.

2115,Hahaha...what a maroon.
2116,"He tried to meet them halfway, but of course that wasn't enough for his critics."
2117,"If the article is correct, it would seem Obama was named personally, not his administration."
2118,"As an NC resident currently, I have never heard more people talk about how much they hate Hillary than I have in this state.  Everybody I know is voting Trump at this point, which is just as alarming as a vote for Clinton."
2119,She *cannot* be allowed to win.  
2120,I find it absolutely hilarious that this seems to be most people's reason to vote Trump. If that's the best thing about a candidate then we should really rethink our political priorities. 
2121,"It's the same reason many people are voting Clinton.  It works both ways.  They are both the worst possible candidates that could have been picked from the pool to be running for president.  I will never vote for either one, but at least Trump is against the TPP.  I'll never know what Clinton stands for because she panders and changes her mind all of the time.  "
2122,Imagine that!  Government employees have opinions too!
2123,"DoJ are mostly lawyers. Lawyers are mostly liberal (like all jobs that require a secondary degree), government lawyers are general liberal at even higher rates. Most of them worked private sector at some point so 2700 isnt a huge amount for them.

Basically: not particularly surprising."
2124,"People in public service supporting the campaigns of people who care about public service!? Call the cops! Wait, no, they also care about public service! Call mall security!"
2125,"Great, they donated to Clinton.  Is there something here I should be seeing?  Lynch did exactly what she said she would do (accept the FBI's suggestion).  This is straight conspiracy nonsense"

-Directed by M. Night Shyamalan"
2131,"If this was going the other direction I'd be concerned. This just shows that people with degrees in law tend to think Clinton is the better candidate.

If anything, this wins her points in my book."
2132,"And look at that, Trump even has far fewer donors than Romney at this same time in the race 29 for Romney 3 for Trump. McCain had even more.

Good job showing how Trump sucks at fund raising and scares people that have an understanding of the law."

2143,"Not just degrees in law, highly qualified lawyers that chose public service. These people are at the level where starting salary is $180,000. Instead they chose a much less profitable career path. These people are overwhelmingly liberal policy wonks, just like Clinton."
2144,"So... About 1% of 1% of all of her donations came from goverment employees?

Ok...

Even Bernie has thousands more donated from the employees of AT&T."
2145,Because you are promoting a conspiracy theory with no hard evidence. 
2146,Explain Comey then.
2147,Trial lawyers largely oppose conservative attempts to put statutory caps on jury awards. 
2148,"Bernie's wife was also a president of a Liberal arts college,the school went under due to financial reasons. Sanders is promising free education. "
2149,"In 2013, Comey was appointed as the director of the FBI by President Barack Obama.

Obama scratched his back,now he scratches Obama's back."
2150,"That's an overly simplistic trope. Most lawyers are not plaintiff's trial lawyers. And while that might impact your vote for a state representative, it has little bearing on a national election, since congress/POTUS aren't setting damage caps for state trial courts."

2157,To figure out a way to takeover redstate
2158,"to force comey in to announcing the result, keeping lynch out of the limelight and not the one explaining how they let Hillary off"
2159,"Didn't click, but the timing makes it suspiciously like Lynch was telling Bill that Hillary was good to go. 

There's people who are corrupt or too stupid to understand that they shouldn't work to make it appear that way. Bill meets Lynch. Lynch steps down and says she's turning it over to Comey who almost immediately clears Hillary.

If that isn't corrupt it might as well be as far as appearances of credibility is concerned. "
2160,Good answer. 
2161,[removed]
2162,"I think Comey did his job, but he has *appeared* to have been tainted by this  meeting.  His credibility is in question through no fault of his own really. He made a call on a very controversial person who has lots of haters and fans. It is guilt hrough association, he is surrounded by corruption.

"
2163,"Who will ever know?

One person who did was Comey himself. I would have thought ""Don't make this look like a done deal"" by the timing. "
2164,Every decision will be questioned but one can mitigate or reinforce opinions of misconduct. The quick sequence of events after Bill visited makes me suspicious and I'm fighting that. I despise Hillary. That said I would rather not assume widespread corruption. 
2165,"Yeah, I'm sure the police weren't trying to spin this by ""accidentally"" losing their body cameras. /s"
2166,"It's not really ""spin"" when it's something that actually happened..."
2167,"Yea... there's [civilian footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBZPCDqymyo) (<-- not for the squeamish, obviously) of two white cops pinning down a black guy and one of them shooting him point blank in the face, while neither cop's body-cam was filming.

What did you expect?"
2168,Breitbutt racist fucks spin has already begun in baton rouge shooting.
2169,"While he was being detained he reached for his gun. An officer told him to stop.

After a moment he then reached for it a second time, and was told to stop. He didn't stop, so they subdued him.

Pro tip, if you're being detained by police, don't try and pull a gun on them."
2170,"Just waiting to find out what kind of gun was recovered at the crime scene. 

This is pretty open-and-shut.

If he was in fact reaching for a gun (which is very blatantly implied multiple times) then the officers should face no charges. "
2171,"They always pick the best examples: probably a gang member, has extensive rap sheet including pedophilia, cops responding to someone being threatened with a gun, suspect (who has a gun) resisting arrest. Not saying the cops are innocent but ffs find a better case to make an example of."
2172,"Wait, their cams were off?
"
2173,Obviously this was the work of BLM. They're basically domestic terrorists.
2174,[removed]
2175,"Which is what the cops have said, but the other witnesses have not backed them up. Also, it's legal to have a gun on you in Louisiana. They didn't have a right to attack him in the first place. If they had questions, they should have asked him questions. Instead, they started the encounter by beating him and ended it by shooting him when he had nothing in his hands. 

If all you can see is ""job well done by the cops"" you need to think harder about what kind of public servants you want to have. "
2176,Additional pro-tip: don't be black.
2177,"Not to mention he was a convicted felon, which means having a gun in the first place is a no no, let alone reaching for it while being detained."
2178,Summary execution of people with a checkered past is still an awful problem
2179,Why don't you ever hear about cases like John Crawford? It's strange 
2180,"News this morning reported that both cops had body cameras.

Neither captured footage of this event.

It remains unclear why there is no body-cam footage of the events -- it's not a settled question at this point.

One explanation I heard on the news is that they were ""dislodged in the scuffle,"" and that's why they didn't capture what they were meant to capture.

"
2181,"> the guy had a gun


Correction: the police yelled ""he's got a gun"" but they have yet to prove that he was in possession of a gun, let alone using one to threaten officers while he was pinned to the ground."
2182,"> the guy had a gun, i'll buy everyone here reddit gold if it turns out to be registered


And if you're right about that, he could be facing weapons charges right now, **if they hadn't fucking shot him in the face.**"
2183,The guy was pinned down and unable to reach for anything. He was executed at point blank range. Stop trying to make excuses for this kind of behavior.
2184,But I thought owning and carrying a gun was an american right? 
2185,"Sure he had a gun. But he was also pinned to the ground. I havent seen the video, was the gun even in his hand? If not there was no reason to execute him. "
2186,"Well, since Louisiana doesn't have gun registration laws, that's probably a safe bet on your part."
2187,Sign me up fuckboi
2188,He was a convicted felon in possession of a CONCEALED FIREARM. How fucking dense can you be?
2189,"That would probably help, yes. Unfortunate as it is to say, there *is* racism in our police departments. 

That said, if you're repeatedly trying to pull a gun on an officer that's detaining you, what else do you really expect? The cop to just let the guy shoot him?"
2190,"Or just don't be a dipshit Convicted Felon/while in possession of an Illegally concealed weapon/reach for weapon. But hey, gotta keep on with that BLM rhetoric. They act like this man is a mercenary instead of calling for the end of violence in their own neighborhoods where bright young children are shot and killed every day. "
2191,"i've seen this happen multiple times. i mean, it doesn't matter if the gun was 'illegal' or not.

you don't reach for your gun while getting detained. that's a recipe for getting justifiably shot.

also, i love how i got downvoted for saying this is open-shut xD"
2192,When did I say/imply summary execution is ok. I merely pointed out the optics on this case aren't all that great

It provides a way for Congress to impeach officials. 

>In the United States, impeachment can occur both at the federal and state level. The Constitution defines impeachment at the federal level and limits impeachment to ""The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States"" who may be impeached and removed only for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"".[21] Several commentators have suggested that Congress alone may decide for itself what constitutes a ""high crime or misdemeanor"", especially since Nixon v. United States stated that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly ""tried"" a defendant.[22] In 1970, then-House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford defined the criterion as he saw it: ""An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.""[23]

Please quote me on what this is in response to.  I never said he would go to jail.  I said he could be impeached and that violating the Constitution is a crime.  For example, denying a black person the right to vote based on skin color is a crime.  Punishment is what happens after the crime.

"
2321,">It provides a way for Congress to impeach officials.

Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding. 

>Although the subject of the charge is criminal action, it does not constitute a criminal trial; the only question under consideration is the removal of the individual from office, and the possibility of a subsequent vote preventing the removed official from ever again holding political office in the jurisdiction where he was removed. Impeachment with respect to political office should not be confused with witness impeachment.

None of this is true. Denying a black person the right to vote is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The constitution dictates no criminal punishment for those who deny others the right to vote. If we didn't have the Voting Rights Act, it wouldn't be a crime. It would be illegal, but not criminal. There's a difference between illegal and criminal. Federal criminal punishments are all outlined in the US penal code, not the constitution. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_18_of_the_United_States_Code"
2322,"Is the Constitution the top law?

What is crime?  Crime is breaking the law.  

Punishment is different than crime.  They are different words since they are different things.  Denying based on race is a Constitutional crime.  Punishment and crime are different things.  They are different words and thus different.  Can you understand this?"

Meh.  There is already damage to the party and the candidate.  Putting Biden means the DNC admits its mistake.

I think this guy is right, Biden would wipe the floor with Trump.

Clinton, with all her flaws, all the media support, no press conferences, spending tens of millions on ads vs $0 for Trump, is only, what, 5-6 points ahead?

Marine Reserve Maj.

2403,"Thats great. Someone who doesn't adhere to the Disney story of heroes and villains that the US establishment desperately clings to.

I guess some would prefer an ""extremely careless"" president who says things like ""We came. We saw. He died."" regarding our assassinations of foreign leaders. 

I can see why Hillary gets a pass on promoting and carrying out assassinations as Secretary of State but Trump should be held to the fire for pointing out Iraq was more stable under Saddam.

Oh and by the way, that report from the UK about the Iraq war? It states rather clearly that it was well known we would be promoting terrorism and that invading Iraq would require immense long term financing and commitment to carry out yet the US had zero plans for this. Remember Hillary voting for this?

""We came. We saw. He died."" *chuckle*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmIRYvJQeHM

Oh but lets all talk about Trump and how bad he is! Oh no! He stated, factually, that Iraq was more stable under Saddam! Oh no! Quick, lets talk about this and not how Hillary Clinton just got off on criminal charges due to the politicization of the justice department! Don't worry about how Hillary lied to the American public for the last year in order to force them to vote for either her or Trump and ensure Sanders would be out of the picture by the time the truth came out. Don't think of those things, just worry about Trump talking about Saddam! No, not about how Hillary was part of destabilizing Iraq. Just about how silly Trump is to talk about Saddam in any positive light."
2404,Saying that they bring stability or praising one specific thing is not the same as putting them on a pedestal as exemplary human beings.
2405,"Of course this won't get upvoted,  thanks to our beloved Trump supporters here on r/politics. "
2406,"He praised positive traits, not the fact that they killed millions of fucking people. He has called them all bad people."
2407,"While hillary takes money from qataries, saudis, and emiraties modern slavers, human traffckers, and murderers...but trump said hussein was better for the middle east and hes the monster? Lol"
2408,Trump's mentors.
2409,"Wow after a decade of hearing liberals rail against overthrowing foreign leaders and how it's all our fault isis is here because we destroyed Sadam army etc. 

Now that a Republican says it suddenly the left has a very short memory. Where you at code pink? "
2410,"I'm voting third party, fuck this. "
2411,Don't forget he also used to support Clinton.
2412,"The problem wasnt Trump pointing out that Iraq was more stable under Iraq,  the problem was Trump was Praising Saddams methods to combat terrorism.  

You are making a less ridiculous Trump strawman to defend."
2413,That one specific thing he praised was Saddams evil methods.  
2414,You act like elections are decided on subtlety and nuance. They aren't. Trump praised a mass murdering tyrant.
2415,"I mean, you're talking about someone who praised a [Chinese dictator who slaughtered protestors in 1989](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-tiananmen-square-china-playboy-interview). 

But I must say, the mental gymnastics Trump supporters go through at this point of the election is impressive."
2416,Saddams methoids to combat terrorism were not positive.  
2417,">“He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good,” Trump said during a campaign event in Raleigh, N.C., Tuesday evening. “They didn’t read them the rights — they didn’t talk, they were a terrorist, it was over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq. It’s like Harvard. Okay? So sad.” 

Can you explain to me how this statement differs from current US policy? Keep in mind we currently indefinitely detain ""enemy combatants"" of the War on Terror, i.e. anyone on the planet who has been accused, without trial and with no regards for their rights as they are foreign PoWs.

If you admit they are the same then it follows his statement about Iraq being like Harvard for terrorism implies that Saddam used to do what the US currently does and it was effective. Except now the US has to do it instead of Saddam and there is zero reason we are doing it other than our own failures in removing Saddam and placing ourselves in his role without a better solution."
2418,Killing terrorists?
2419,"yea he only called him a terrible guy 7 times before saying atleast the middle east was stable before we took out sadam. Nothing he said was false.

Sometimes people with barbaric beliefs only believe the worst of the barbarians. Look at the leaders and governments of the middle east. Besides jordan they all suck.

And even the people of jordan want to get rid of their king for the muslim brotherhood."
2420,The Tiananmen Sq uprising was a riot by orthodox communist students against the (liberalising) reforms of Deng Xiaoping. It had to be put down.
2421,"He didn't praise his methods, he praised the fact that Saddam actually did kill terrorists."
2422,If what he was praising is no different than what we are already doping than i dont see why he brought it up.  Though his past comments about killing the family of terrorists put his comments in context.  He supports the brutality of Saddams methods.  
2423,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989

> The protests were forcibly suppressed after the government declared martial law. In what became widely known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks killed unarmed civilians trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated at anywhere between hundreds and thousands.

Yea, someone really needed to show those out-of-line unarmed college students who wears the pants in their democracy.  "
2424,"""They didn’t read them the rights — they didn’t talk""

Those were methods he was praising.  "
2425,"Read: ""people Saddam considered terrorists, right alongside actual terrorists."""
2426,"And how does this differ from Clinton and the above video of her quoted saying, ""We came. We saw. He died. *laughted*"" in regards to assassination of a foreign leader?

I mean, Trump is framed as ""brutal"" but Clinton is already an FBI confirmed liar who jokes about rape and murder when she knows she is being recorded."
2427,China isn't a democracy.
2428,So not giving rights to terrorists in *Iraq* is a bad thing? Okay.
2429,"Clinton has not supported the killing of the family of terrorists,  nor praised Saddams methods.  "
2430,"Saddam did much more than that,  and Trumps support of the killing of the terrorists families indicates that hes on Saddams page.  "
2431,"Clinton, as Secretary of State, was part of drone assassinations which undoubtedly killed civilian family members. So in what world can you say she doesn't support it when she actively did it already?

What did Hillary say about Saddam again?

>""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.""
>-- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002

Oh thats right, she repeated the lie we all know everyone knew was a lie now about him trying to get nuclear weapons, helping to drag us into the Iraq War at the behest of Bush."
2432,Targeting innocent people and collateral damage are entirely different as far as morality.  
2433,"What about when you realize the US classified anyone who criticized the US occupation as spreading ""terrorist propaganda"" and killed them as leaked by people like Chelsea Manning? Who exactly is being droned? What about this person's story of being hunted by drones for being part of a local government group in Pakistan who publicly asked the US to stop trying to kill him? What about killing US citizens without a trial because they are an ""imminent threat"" but the reasoning is hidden behind national secrecy?

You seem to have a narrative in your mind that was placed there by the people who are bombing civilians in far away places. People like Hillary Clinton."
2434,"Again,  targeting innocent civilians and inadvertently killing them through collateral damage are entirely different.  There are good arguments against drones,  but as far as im concerned arguing whether to target innocents is hell of a lot more concerning.  Arguing collateral damage while targeting innocents is like arguing about dinner when your house is burning down.  "

2437,There's a title I never in my life expected to see coming from an election for president of the United states
2438,"I don't see any reason why the Democratic strategy shouldn't be to keep making a fuss over minor things like this. As we've seen, Trump will be on the constant defensive, because he can't shut up about something until he believes everyone thinks he's right. "
2439,"What you ultra PC clowns fail to see is when you call a star racist and Trump gets #Frozen trending with a star in it, it's you who looks dumb.  Outside of your safe space normal people are wise to your identity politics, race baiting, and fake manufactured outrage.  Your laughably poor and pathetic strategy failed in the UK and it will fail in the US.  It's work so well for liberals in the past, but it's obviously a failing strategy with Trump."

2456,"Bigotry is not actually a functional long term proposition for a political party in a democracy. The GOP has always understood this and even though their voting base has been largely white they'd never just openly start denigrating whole races. 

Donald Trump on the other hand gives  absolutely zero fucks about the long term viability of the Republican party so he has openly embraced every form of bigotry in the hope of temporary adulation from his white male fan base. God willing this will all result in his humiliating defeat, otherwise it will be the end of American democracy."
2457,"> Beinstein was more than happy to explain how Drumpf’s message referred to age-old tropes about Jews and why the explanation that it was something else didn’t convince him:

> > “Tying Hillary Clinton to the pockets of rich, wealthy Jews totally advances a corrupt narrative,” he wrote. “In fact, it’s the same exact way Adolf Hitler got elected, by blaming all of Germany’s problems on the Jews. Drumpf, not too differently, seems to suggest all of America’s problems come from Mexicans, Muslims, Hispanics, Jews, etc. (don’t forget Hitler also threw in blacks, gypsies, and gays to the mix).”

Hey look, there are some sensible, non-bigots in the Republican party!

Mr Trump, your dismantling of the Republican party is in fact under budget and ahead of schedule.

You are a remarkable wrecking ball."
2458,"Linking to AEI is like linking to Stormfront, only Stormfront has better manners.  "
2459,"Granted that is normally true but unless you are willing to say the data from the Association of American Medical Colleges is somehow racist then put it back in the deck. 

The fact is many colleges and universities are trying to make up for decades of discrimination against minorities. Wherever you stand on this practice, it is hard to disagree that declaring ""all students are equal but some students are more equal than others"" is affirmative racism."
2460,"I don't think admitting students that have received chronically underfunded educations and grew up in chronically economically disenfranchised households is 'racism' of any kind.  

Calling it ""racism"" kind of tips your hand a bit.  "
2461," I 100% agree with you that underfunded education and economically disenfranchised households are a major problem and ensuring they have access to education is the best way for them to get out of the cycle of poverty.

That said we are talking about medical school so given the importance of the work these students will do it is imperative the best are chosen for admittance. I don't think the answer to underfunded education system is putting national health at risk by allowing less than qualified students to go into the medical field.

As for the tipping my hand by calling it racism. I define racism as treating one group differently, in and affirmative or negative way, based on their race."
2462,"So if you see someone with lots of melanin, it's safe and progressive to conclude that they grew up with an underfunded education and a chronically economically disenfranchised household?

Sounds like racism to me."
2463,"If there was a demonstrable difference between the quality of work from affirmative action admits and regular admits, I might agree with you. But there's not. No study has ever shown that black doctors are worse than white doctors."
2464,TIL people don't understand what statistics are.
2465,"Do you think the colleges actually measure and confirm each individual's economic and educational disenfranchisement?  Because you really should consider that they are just using race as a proxy for those things.

>However, ‘priority’ for federal dollars is to be given only to those institutions offering ‘preferential’ admissions to underrepresented minorities (according to race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation and religion….). Thus, schools will be unable to compete for essential federal funding unless they adopt admission policies that intentionally and deliberately discriminate.”

They aren't saying let's help the chronically undereducated and disenfranchised.  They're saying (racial group) is undereducated and disenfranchised, so we'll help everyone in (racial group)."
2466,">Do you think the colleges actually measure and confirm each individual's economic and educational disenfranchisement?

I know that they do.  It's called ""Financial Aid.""  

>They aren't saying let's help the chronically undereducated and disenfranchised. They're saying (racial group) is undereducated and disenfranchised, so we'll help everyone in (racial group).

I'm sure you didn't mean to say it this way, but what you said here also includes the idea that there are no minority students who qualify for admission to med school.  Which is a horrifying suggestion, and therein lies my counterargument - you casually assumed here that all minority admits were AA admits, when in fact only some were. 

The answer is yes, since the test can't be performed with universal accuracy, we admit minority doctors on the assumption that they were disenfranchised.  If we're cool with the police performing extrajudicial executions of minorities because they are threatening and have criminal records, we should also be OK with med schools advancing some minorities as well.

""*In July 2000, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, collaborating with the United Nations to eradicate heroin production in Afghanistan, declared that growing poppies was un-Islamic, resulting in one of the world's most successful anti-drug campaigns. The Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas, roughly three quarters of the world's supply of heroin at the time.[16] The ban was effective only briefly due to the deposition of the Taliban in 2002.*""

It's really disheartening to see Republicans actually *gain* voters in their primaries, we're watching that party go through a major transformation.

2008 was an exceptional primary, I think. Between the idiocy of the Bush years, the wars, and the financial collapse, people were fired up. And on top of all of that, it was the first time in our history, when the top 2 candidates were both not a white guy.

It's really hard to overstate just how crazy and unprecedented that year was. So, I'm not too concerned about the turnout being lower. Frankly, it would alarm me if it was as high as it was in that cycle.

The past few weeks have been a series of victories for Sanders and his push for a more progressive democratic platform. $15 minimum wage, death penalty, free community college, expanded social security, overturning citizens united, banning assault weapons. 

Senators can boo, the media can complain but Bernie has accomplished most of what he was hoping to by staying in. This is all spin. History will remember who was on the right and wrongs sides of it.

27,834,835 total votes. Sanders had 12,029,699 votes. 43.5% is 12,108,153.

I'll certainly concede that Sanders did very well, considering he was a relative no name prior to this, but 2016 was not a close race."

You could say that. But, by any measure you want to look at, you'd be completely wrong."
2507,"Agreed. People have a short memory and fail to remember that Democrats have *always* had a hard time getting their voters to turn out. This is not a Hillary phenomena. But it is an excellent myopic way of viewing history, to make it fit with a narrative. "

2519,Progressive party calling to bailout middle class college grads. 
2520,"The way Stein is proposing using QE on student debt is incoherent. 

QE isn't a magic trick like she says it is. It expands the money supply, but it doesn't cancel debts. It lowers longer-term interest rates and helps ward off the risk of deflation.

Stein often compares her QE proposal to the bailouts in 2007-2008, but there's no direct comparison. Toxic assets were purchased in the Great Recesssion, then payed back with interest, not cancelled, as she wants to do for student debts. The government earned a net gain.

In addition, if student debt were to be forgiven, that amount would then count as [taxable](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc431.html) income.  Stein hasn't said about how this would be handled.

As a recent graduate, I'd love to not drown in debt, but Stein's policy to address this is incoherent and misinformed. She needs a better financial policy team."
2521,The green party needs to focus on mobilization considering as it stands they won't be on half of the general election ballots. Seems to me like Sanders took a large portion of their usual support and while that support is beginning to return it may be too late and the Green party this year could be at a bigger disadvantage then they have been in the past even though this would be the best chance of an upset. 
2522,Too bad all their other ideas are batshit.
2523,"IMO, they need to focus on small communities, agricultural innovation, and work to be the Second Coming of the Grange, etc. and develop a more distinct identity of their own instead of just trying to (poorly) copy Sanders or appealing to the white-kids-with-dreads constituency. They need to give people reasons to vote *for* the Greens instead of as Sanders' ""Plan B"" or as a protest vote."
2524,They need to make people think they aren't a joke. If you walk into a crowded place of random people and talk about the green party at best you'd be called a hippy and that is because that illusion still exists.
2525,Sanders actually got his ideas from the Greens. Not vice-versa.
2526,"No, he didn't. 

Sanders gets his ideas from his version of democratic socialism. He's been calling himself socialist for his entire political career, since the 60's. The Green political movement has its origins in the German ecological movement, and die Grünen was first established in West Germany in 1980. 

Many of the positions are similar, and they're both left-wing, but Sanders' positions are rooted in socialism, not the Green movement."
2527,I've been schooled.
2528,Knowing is half the battle! :)

2532,"Neither of them ""get it"".  They are both using a horrible massacre to promote their own political agendas which is one of the nastier aspects of US politics.  Neither care about France or extremism or what supports the rage that gives vent to massacres like this.  It's all potential campaign fodder for both, that is all."

2544,"I didn't DV, but it is probably from disagreement with the sentiment.

2548,"No. All I'm saying is that the French need to realize that they do not exist in a bubble from which they can strike terrorists in Syria and not expect a response. To quote Glenn Greenwald:

>It is always stunning when a country that has brought violence and military force to numerous countries acts shocked and bewildered when someone brings a tiny fraction of that violence back to that country. Regardless of one’s views on the justifiability of [France]’s lengthy military actions, it’s not the slightest bit surprising or difficult to understand why people who identify with those on the other end of [French] bombs and bullets would decide to attack the military responsible for that violence.

>That’s the nature of war. A country doesn’t get to run around for years wallowing in war glory, invading, rendering and bombing others, without the risk of having violence brought back to it. Rather than being baffling or shocking, that reaction is completely natural and predictable. The only surprising thing about any of it is that it doesn’t happen more often."
2549,"Yes, we should ignore the fact that presidents are chosen by hu-mans with hu-man feelings, and instead pretend they are chosen by emotionally inert, perfectly logical robots. "
2550,sad
2551,"No, we should ensure that laws can be applied to best protect people without violating peoples rights. That requires the 'cerebral bubble' and not emotional reactions. 

This is why we don't confiscate all guns after Sandy Hook or round up all Muslims in reaction to ISIS."
2552,She could use emotional rhetoric without engaging in unconstitutional legal acts. It might even help her get elected president. 
2553,"Voters like me appreciate steps that might address the causes of terrorism. To me that shows a steady hand, leadership. Perhaps she could sell it better.

Declaring double war on terrorism is unhelpful. It is an angry platitude at best, and a call for government sponsored attacks on rights at worst. 

To me, the author has it backwards. Though I have been accused of being an emotionless robot, so maybe I'm not representative of most voters."

2563,Words do not cause physical harm.
2564,Que?
2565,Religious fanaticism is more accurate. While we are seeing more and more Islamic Jihadism i wouldn't say Muslim culture is completely to blame. Remember we had a functional middle east once upon a time that was Muslim. 
2566,"Man, if only Obama could say 'radical Islam' all of those terrorists will see the error of their ways and convert to Christianity."
2567,"Because it makes no difference. They use terminology like that in France and it hasn't magically stopped terrorism.

I have serious problems with Islam but I still don't say ""radical Islam"" at this point solely because the insane fixation the GOP has on that term is hilarious."
2568,"Who the fuck cares?  And the reason has been explained over and fucking over. Saying we're fighting Islam is exactly what ISIS wants, a ""holy war"" with the west. 

And it's not like we're ignoring them. We literally have been bombing them so much we nearly fucking ran out of bombs. "
2569,'Muslim Terrorists' is more accurate.

2575,"Why can't republicans say ""Radical Christianity""?"
2576,"Because House of Saud is a major supporter of the party, a major contributor to the Clinton Foundation, is invested heavily in social & traditional media companies which is left aligned. They are part of the globalist power block.

2577,"Clinton recently has.

So has Obama

Whoops."
2578,"It's not radical, most of the views are fairly mainstream. "
2579,It provides political cover and absolves Islam of the monsters it creates.
2580,I don't think the US can run out of bombs.
2581,Is this a veiled plea for increased military spending?
2582,"Ueah, but there aren't that many here yet. We can kill them all and it'll be over. "
2583,"I would agree except that ""Muslim terrorists"" ignores the ideology that binds them together. It's an extremist take on an otherwise peaceful religion. It's a silly semantic argument, and, at this point, I'm sure democrats avoid the term just to fuck with republicans. "
2584,"Jihadist terrorists is the most accurate, even if it's somewhat redundant. There are many Muslims who consider these to be Muslims in name only."

2586,"Are they shooting up night clubs,are they gunning down people at Christmas parties, are they flying planes into buildings, are they killing concert goers?"

2606,"That's what Chief Tall Tree said in 1617.  He added ""We have nothing to fear.  Christianity is a Religion Of Peace.  All you people are racist for thinking we should take this more seriously."""
2607,Are you saying that propaganda and mass murder are in any way equivalent?
2608,"Versus multiple shootings this year, by less than 1% of the population.  "
2609,Not Christian specific
2610,Maybe they are referring to the incident in November last year in Colorado - three people killed (I think).
2611,"Someone shot up a PP building, killing quite a few people, it WAS a mass murder."
2612,Just letting you know that it still goes on fairly frequently that's all.
2613,"Shooting up and bombing abortion clinics, shooting up and arson to Planned Parenthood clinics, Eric Rudolph and so much more.

Religion poisons everything."
2614,"OK, that makes more sense."
2615,But much less than radical Islamists
2616,"After the reformation, sure
"
2617,What reformation?
2618,"Well lets just forget about Turkey's backdoor support for ISIS because ISIS was killing Kurds.

Just remember what happened to the Armenians.

Those are the people that we are supporting."
2619,The next 24hrs will be interesting. If Erdogan's call for civil unrest fails and the coup leaders call for early elections then this event could stay bloodless. That is if foreign influence doesn't want a hand in the reshaping of that government...
2620,"> It is unclear what, if any, obligation the U.S. would have to come to Turkey’s defense as a NATO ally. The Article 5 provision of the NATO alliance requires countries to come to the aid of a fellow ally in case of attack,

Wouldn't it be nice if a journalist checked to see what happened the last couple times Turkey had a military coup?"

2659,"I see! Too subtle. Plenty of ISIS fought Americans troops in Iraq and Afganisran wars, so both are actual direct examples."
2660,"Turkey is our ally in NATO. They have strategic value in the Middle East. Whether or not you want to accuse Erdogan of rigging elections is irrelevant, because the entire world (not just the U.S.) recognizes him as the democratically elected leader of Turkey. To not support him in favor of the unknown is detrimental to the interests of the U.S. For fuck's sake, there are nuclear weapons in Turkey. It's not rocket science, people. It is common sense to support him, especially with what intel I'm sure the U.S. government had of the situation."
2661,"Well, if he's murdering people, supporting global terrorism, and violating people's civil rights, wouldn't that be something to be against regardless of their elected status? I mean, I don't want to compare him to Hitler because clearly he's not going *that* far, but I will make the comparison of that fact that Hitler was a democratically elected official as well."
2662,"Yes, it would be. But if we did that, then we should calling out other world powers like Russia. Turkey isn't some third world country. To my knowledge their ""support of ISIS"" wasn't supporting global terrorism, they used the group to destabilize Syria for their country's own interest, not ISISs. They would not be the only government in the world to turn a blind eye to destabilizing forces in other countries, because it benefits them. 

When Erdogan turns to genocide it becomes an issue. But he hasn't. He's an EU hungry Islamic sycophant whose country is geopolitically beneficial to the interests of Europe and the U.S.  In many ways, a lot like Putin. Despised but needed. "
2663,"If you support ISIS, you support global terrorism, I mean, in case you haven't noticed, ISIS hasn't really been keeping their attacks to just Syria.

Now I'm not saying that Erdogan doing anything that he's being accused of, because of course, how the hell would I really know, I live in the US and haven't been paying attention to Turkey.

I am simply stating that, it doesn't matter if someone is democratically elected, if they're doing evil, you don't support them."
2664,They turned a blind eye to them. That's much different than contributing to their numbers. And most accounts of what has happened over there are just accusations. That does not make the President or Clinton any less correct to support Erdogan. The world is not all smiles and sunshine. Our allies are not scrupulous people. We are not scrupulous people. Turkey benefits both the interests of the U.S. and the EU in the Middle East.

2672,Muslamic  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjuNuqIev8M
2673,Islamomania is actually a really good one. I never heard that before. It is accurate
2674,Thats the problem with trying to maintain an empire...you can make a case to put almost anything here.
2675,"would you consider for example Okinawa or Ramstein to be off-topic? the United States has a military base in Turkey and has also stationed Nuclear deterrence in Europe and Turkey, any growth of islamism, civil unrest and instablity could be a direct concern for the people of the United States"
2676,"Obama and clinton backed these people so yes, this is relevant "
2677,"It's not a question of true or false, that's not the problem. Rarely do outlets get away with a straight-up falsehood.

It's more to do with sensationalism and hyper emotive language. Better to post dispassionate outlets that focus on facts before flavour.

The Daily Express is garbage."
2678,"ok I'm not sure about the Express myself...it seems kinda rightwing conservative...but we should not shoot the messenger for reporting facts of news just because we do not like the messenger. This u/Tchocky guy? poor social justice warrior regressive lefts like this are always getting 'triggered'...their safe spaces invaded LMFAO. I don't think he likes 'the Express' ..so another link for him http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-latest-news-istanbul-ankara-erdogan-twitter-beheading-social-media-a7140541.html maybe you can find him a better sources, maybe he only accepts leftwing sources like BBC, CNN, news from Cuba, North Korea, Pravda etc"

2680,"There are quite some nuclear weapons in that base, and it's been locked off by Turkey, the power cut off.

They also seem to blame the religious/political movement Gülen for this coup. The leader lives in Pennsylvania.
Erdogan already said any country helping Gülen should be considered an enemy of Turkey.
So yeah, I'd say Turkey is quite relevant to the US at the moment.

That being said, I don't like your source (Express is a rag) and I think that news has already been debunked by now. 

All in all this entire 'coup' seems to only have made Erdogan more powerful, now with an excuse for a proper purge of his political opponents and cause to declare a state of emergency as well. It almost looks set up in that respect.

I do not want replaced with a stone age labor slave because I used birth control, I do not want my society irrevocably altered by zealous incompatible segregated religious communities who violate everything I stand for as an American.

2692,"This is where the far left fails the American people. We want to end the war. The best way to end a war is by winning it. The Democrat party causes endlesswar by not identifying the enemy, trying to contain the enemy and accepting limited losses. That only emboldens the Muslim Terrorists trying to kill us, prolongs the conflict and causes more death and destruction. If we had fought decades ago to win this war (a war we didn't want and didn't start) we'd have saved countless lives on both sides and started the rehabilitation of our enemy to make them our friend.

2702,"Insurgencies end one of two ways, historically. 

The public rejects the insurgents, or there's a political settlement. Rarely are groups like ISIS defeated through military force. This is what the GOP fails to grasp and its why the Bush administration was a total failure. You can't impose your will, violently, on the middle east and expect it not to fall into the hands of these people. 

Vietnam should have been a wake up call for this country. "
2703,Will not work against religious fundamentalists. This is nothing like WWII.  
2704,"France tends to isolate both immigrants and the poor in large high rise style public housing projects way out in the middle of nowhere, away from jobs, education, and opportunity. Add this to a pretty steong streak of french nationalism/anti immigrant sentiment, and you get poorly integrated immigrant populations. There is also the history of french colonialism in africa to consider, particularly in Algeria, where they engaged in a pretty brutal civil war."
2705,"Sorry, I don't engage in discussions with novelty accounts.

2710,"That is a hopelessly naive view of life under the Taliban. They disfigured, beat and killed (female) children who went to school. They blew up all of the schools they did not approve. Afghanistan has been involved in a near continuous series of bloody conflicts for hundreds of years. The coup that ended the monarchy and established it as a republic in 1973, triggered a succession of coups and assassinations. Then came the PDPA and the soviet invasion.  

The call to religious orthodoxy is a multi-nation movement that has resulted in extremist ideology being the driving force in their politics. The idea that it is a response to western intervention is incorrect. We are just obstacles to the establishment of a caliphate or righteous sharia theocracy.  
"
2711,Nothing is like anything else. To say we can't win though is defeatism and un-American. We can win the war with Muslim Terrorists but only if we first decide we want to win.

But hey, maybe you're right, and destroying stuff is the only way. That's how we won Vietnam, right?"
2718,You cannot bomb an idea. It just makes that idea more insane.
2719,"Gore would have done just what Bubba did and Obama is doing-ignore the problem, shake a fist, promise not to rest until justice is served, launch a few missiles at empty targets, and tell the American people that their policies are a success and that we have to accept limited killings to avoid total war. "
2720,"'Whose administration ignored intelligence on bin Laden?'

Bill Clinton when the Sudanese had bin Laden in custody and offered him to the U.S. Clinton feared the political fallout and declined."
2721,That's not at all true. It's also defeatism. We can do anything we put our mind to. Nazism and Imperialism were ideas. We defeated them.
2722,[deleted]
2723,"That's a pretty well debunked myth. A self-appointed non-state actor who was considered unstable by our intelligence agencies offered to sell bin Laden to the U.S. We explored the offer, determined it to be unreliable, and declined.

Here's the snopes page debunking the ""Clinton passed on OBL"" nonsense: http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp"
2724,Ideas can only be defeated by ideas. We beat the Germans through fighting but defeated nazis through better ideas. That foolish invasion of Iraq and the predictable outcome is stupidity at its finest and has only inflamed the situation.
2725,"I'm sorry he reversed course and decided not to fight Muslim Terrorism.

This nation owes a great debt of gratitude to Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld ,et al for keeping us safe from the scourge of Muslim Terrorism. Thankfully, yours is an opinion held but by a small and insignificant minority of Americans."
2726,You're wrong. It's well documented that the Sudanese president wanted sanctions lifted and offered to arrest & deport bin Laden to make that happen. Clinton not only refused he put pressure on Sudan to send bin Laden back to Afghanistan. 
2727,"You're wrong. First you defeat the enemy in war, then you win them over with ideas. You can't do one before the other. It's important to understand too that we are in a war and have been for decades. Our enemy consider themselves to be at war with us. It's foolish and dangerous to not recognize that. It's also important to understand that we're in a war we didn't want and didn't start. The best way to end this war is to win it. Not doign so only causes more innocent lives to lost.

'foolish invasion of Iraq'

You don't understand how diplomacy and alliances work. Kuwait were are allies. We were duty bound to protect them when Iraq invaded. Bush I put together a coalition and drove them out. Iraq signed a cease-fire agreement that they then proceeded to violate as soon as Clinton, who did nothing, took office. By that means alone we have every right and the duty to invade. We removed a violent despot from power, freed his people, better stabilized the region a brought the inchoate of democracy to the country. All very respectable accomplishments."

2731,"Good job freeing the people of Iraq. Bravo...clap...clap

I don't think you understand the consequences of hamfisting your way into Iraq and blowing up the established order of the entire region with your crusade to ""free"" people. Sensible allies like Canada, France, Germany and countries in the region tried to stop the US from making such a historic blunder because they knew what it would unleash but Murica wasn't having any of that. Good work, mission accomplished."

2781,"SACRAMENTO, CA—Hillary R Clinton, 68, pleaded guilty today to unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials, United States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner announced.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Clinton to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials. Clinton was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance.

According to court documents, Clinton was Secretary of State 2009 to 2013. In her role as Secretary of State, Clinton had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers. Clinton, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on her personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. Clinton continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system.

Clintons actions came to light in March 2015, when the Benghazi Panel had discovered that she had handled classified materials inappropriately. Clinton later admitted that her lawyers destroyed a large quantity of classified materials she had maintained in her home. Despite that, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Clintons home in August 2015, agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms. The investigation did not reveal evidence that Clinton intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel.

This was Bryan Nishimuras FBI's press release that I edited with Clintons name. I'm spamming this because it is so telling. I also know this isn't the marine in the story but I find Nishimuras situation more comparable."

Also, forced out is a bit much: he was **honorably discharged** from the Marine Reserves after having already served terms in combat zones. Defined below:

> A Marine who meets or exceeds all mission, unit, proficiency and personal conduct code requirements is awarded an honorable administrative discharge. Marines excused for medical or psychological issues that impair their ability to serve but would otherwise have performed honorably are also eligible for an honorable discharge. In some cases, Marines awarded other types of discharge have their status amended to honorable, given exceptional achievements in post-military life."

Just like comeys investigation Clinton did not intend to distribute classified information.

We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.""

>There is no question that former Secretary Clinton had authority to delete personal emails without agency supervision – she appropriately could have done so even if she were working on a government server.   Under policies issue both by the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”) and the State Department, individual officers and employees are permitted and expected to exercise judgment to determine what constitutes a federal record.See NARA Bulletin 2014-06 ¶4 (Sept. 15, 2014) (“Currently, in many agencies, employees manage their own email accounts and apply their own understanding of Federal records management. This means that all employees are required to review each message, identify its value, and either delete it or move it to a recordkeeping system.”);3  Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual, 5 FAM 443.2(b) (“[t]he intention of this guidance is not to require the preservation of every E-mail message.”) (attached as Ex. 1)   The purpose of these policies is to direct the preservation of those messages that contain information that is necessary to ensure that “departmental policies, programs, and activities are adequately documented. E-mail message creators and recipients must decide whether a particular message is appropriate for preservation.  In making these decisions, all personnel should exercise the same judgment they use when determining whether to retain and file paper records.

That and back in 2004 the election between Bush and Kerry was pretty tight in terms of the polls going back and forth a few times up until about September when Bush took the lead.

This looks like a disaster if he loses, I mean how is the GOP going to explain nominating Trump to these minority groups that they need to stay viable in the future, particularly Hispanic ones.


That and nomination turnout doesn't mean shit with respect to the polls for the general election otherwise Obama would have won in 2008 by a few points more than he was polling towards instead of right in line with the poll numbers.

>There is a statute that was passed in 1917 that on its face makes it a crime, a felony for someone to engage in **gross negligence**. So that would appear to say, well, maybe in that circumstance you don't need to prove they knew they were doing something that was unlawful, maybe it's enough to prove that they were just really, really careless beyond a reasonable doubt. At the time Congress passed that statute in 1917, there was a lot of concern in the House and the Senate about whether that was going to violate the American tradition of requiring that before you're going to lock somebody up, you prove they knew they were doing something wrong. So there was a lot of concern about it. The statute was passed.

>As best I can tell, the Department of Justice has used it once in the 99 years since, reflecting that same concern. I know from 30 years with the Department of Justice they have grave concerns about whether it's appropriate to prosecute somebody for gross negligence, which is why they have done it once that I know of in a case involving espionage. And so when I look the facts we gathered here, as I said, I see evidence of great carelessness, but I do not see evidence that is sufficient to establish that Secretary Clinton or those with whom she was corresponding both talked about classified information on email and knew when they did it they were doing something that was against the law. So given that assessment of the facts, my understanding of the law, my conclusion was and remains: No reasonable prosecutor would bring this case. No reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years focused on gross negligence. And so I know that's been a source of some confusion for folks. That's just the way it is. I know the Department of Justice, I know no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case. I know a lot of my former friends are out there saying where they would. I wonder where they were the last 40 years, because I'd like to see the cases they brought on gross negligence. Nobody would, nobody did. So my judgment was the appropriate resolution of this case was not with a criminal prosecution. As I said, folks can disagree about that, but I hope they know that view -- not just my view, but of my team -- was honestly held, fairly investigated and communicated with unusual transparency because we know folks care about it."
2876,"I'm not sure why my sentence is being parsed like this.  To simplify:  If an average employee a) depends on someone else to set up a server properly, b)  had no intent to commit a crime and c) no knowledge of one - if  that average employee  were sent to jail, that's just plain wrong.  No one should be convicted of a non-crime.

And Paul Ryan is wrong.  Two wrongs (jail wrong and Ryan wrong) don't make a right."
2877,And he's wrong.
2878,"That's got a miscarriage of justice.

They literally waved the law for her."
2879,The ones refusing to do their job? Sure.
2880,"Yep, the FBI thought that they couldn't prove that she was competent enough to be held liable for her negligence."
2881,"I am answering a narrow legal question: Is there probable cause that Secretary Clinton was grossly negligent with respect to the removal of classified information from its proper place of custody?  The answer is yes.  There is not a rational legal argument in her defense.

As for the rest --- motives, grand politics, etc. --- your guess is as good as mine.  "
2882,"Yeah.  Here's the thing.  Gross negligence is not even the least-culpable mental state.  The nonsense about it being unconstitutional is absurd.  It has been on the books for 100 years.  I don't have an annotated U.S. Code handy but I'm sure it has been invoked more than once in 99 years --- against relatively powerless soldiers, etc.

People are sent to prison every day for crimes requiring less culpability than gross negligence.  For example, every state in the union criminalizes negligent homicide.  Negligence is a lower, less culpable mental state than gross negligence (which is normally referred to as 'recklessness.')  Even more pointed, every state prohibits statutory rape, which is a strict liability crime with no elements addressing mental state.  Most (perhaps all) states also criminalize the distribution of toxic drugs to the public.  This, too, is a strict liability crime.  It doesn't matter at all what the Drug company CEO knew or intended.  It's a crime.

So the notion that gross negligence or recklessness is unconstitutional as an element of the crime is just absurd on its face.

""As best I can tell"" ---- these strike me as weasel words, very much like ""No reasonable prosecutor would bring charges.""  His soliloquy on the historical enforcement of the law is entirely meaningless.  It doesn't matter. His responsibility is to enforce the law as it is written.

This should also be intuitive to you.  Imagine yourself receiving a speeding ticket --- but you have a video of the incident, perhaps a video of thousands of other automobiles traveling the same road at the same speed who were not pulled over or ticketed.  Would you expect this video to be a defense?  Would you expect a judge to watch your video and say, ""Oh, sorry Mr. Anti_Bullshit, we haven't been enforcing the law well enough so you get a free pass?""

Of course not.  The law is specific; the law is passed by Congress; the law gives notice.  The law is most assuredly *not* what someone may argue about historical enforcement under various fact patterns --- particularly not at the indictment stage, which requires mere probable cause, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

I don't know why Comey is saying these things.  I can't explain it; apparently Comey is a man of integrity.  I know about the Ashcroft history, etc.  But even so ....

There is most assuredly probable cause to indict Secretary Clinton for a violation of 18 U.S.C. 793 (f)."
2883,"""...the American tradition of requiring that before you're going to lock somebody up, you prove they knew they were doing something wrong.""

This tradition does not exist. Ignorance of the law is not, and has never been, a valid excuse. "
2884,She's innocent! Case closed 
2885,I mean obviously there is. The director of the FBI explained it clearly for 5 hours today
2886,"> People are sent to prison every day for crimes requiring less culpability than gross negligence.

2890,"Gross negligence = recklessness.   If the offense is a homicide, the mental state of recklessness gets you voluntary manslaughter.  Pull up your state inmates list and  you'll see the faces of plenty of prisoners guilty of gross negligence.

""(f)

Copy paste from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports#Criticism

*Time magazine has described Rasmussen Reports as a ""conservative-leaning polling group.""[83] The Washington Post called Rasmussen a ""polarizing pollster.""[84] John Zogby said that Scott Rasmussen has a ""conservative constituency.""[85] The Center for Public Integrity listed ""Scott Rasmussen Inc"" as a paid consultant for the 2004 George W. Bush campaign.[86] The Washington Post reported that the 2004 Bush re-election campaign had used a feature on the Rasmussen Reports website that allowed customers to program their own polls, and that Rasmussen asserted that he had not written any of the questions nor assisted Republicans.[65] Rasmussen has received criticism over the wording in its polls.[87][88] Asking a polling question with different wording can affect the results of the poll;[89] the commentators in question allege that the questions Rasmussen ask in polls are skewed in order to favor a specific response. For instance, when Rasmussen polled whether Republican voters thought Rush Limbaugh was the leader of their party, the specific question they asked was: ""Agree or Disagree: 'Rush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party — he says jump and they say how high.'""[88] Talking Points Memo has questioned the methodology of Rasmussen's Presidential Approval Index, which takes into account only those who ""strongly"" approve or disapprove of the President's job performance. TPM noted that this inherently skews negative, and reported that multiple polling experts were critical of the concept.[43] A New York Times article claims Ramussen Reports research has a ""record of relying on dubious sampling and weighting techniques.""[90]*

2925,"> Rasmussen Reports

They always lean Republican. Hillary is still squeaking out a victory overall and will beat Trump in swing states. 

She is the next president for 8 years (assuming her health holds out until 2020).  All Hillary has to do is last until November. By that point, the general election voters will not remember *any* of what is happening today. "
2926,And yet the Democratic superdelegates are still going with Hillary instead of Bernie.
2927,"The crosstabs for this Rasmussen poll seem to be... odd.

Trump is up 3 with non-black minorites (Hispanic/Asian/etc) and the poll has Clinton at 69% of black voters.


That is different to say the least."
2928,"when you compare the polls it is helpful to check whether or not the polling outfits are using a two way or a four way race. Then they compare those online polls with the more traditional polls, so the average is probably about right. 

Personally I think Hillary has held on to her slight lead and will beat Trump if she can keep her base and get them to turn out. Otherwise it's going to be a wild ride. "
2929,"Ok, while I agree with your premise, let's not get ahead of ourselves. If Clinton wins in an electoral landslide, it's possible the Republican base might actually learn a lesson and nominate an electable candidate in 4 years."
2930,So are most regular delegates. 
2931,"Because she won a majority of votes and delegates. I supported O'Malley in the primary season, but she ultimately won."
2932,The will of the people must be overturned as Rasmussen has spoken! 
2933,Because 1 poll out of every other one shows Trump with a lead?  One with a at least 4 point lean towards the GOP side of things in how they do their model math?  And over top of the pledged delegate lead that she has?
2934,"Yup, because Clintons own the DNC and Trump is not a threat, Sanders would only beat him worse."
2935,"> it's possible the Republican base might actually learn a lesson and nominate an electable candidate in 4 years.

I mean. Sure. Anything is possible. 

It's also possible (and just as likely) that I could win the lottery and move to Acapulco in the next four years too. :) "
2936,Winning a rigged contest doesn't count if you are aware of the fact.
2937,"Neat. 

Now explain away the millions of independent voters who are allowed to vote in the general but who were not allowed to vote in the primaries. "
2938,"Why not count the millions of Republicans voters who couldn't vote in the Democratic primary but can  vote in the general?

Other then New York almost every state with a closed primary either required you to change affiliation at most 1 month before the primary date or be registered to vote with no party preference.  A situation that **did not change** from 2008.  Independents had pleanty of time to decide which of the two major party primaries they wished to influence and register to do so which can be done at most court houses, sending in a form you can print off from the states website, or even online and all for free, maybe the cost of a stamp and a trip to your local library at most if you want to push implied costs."
2939,"You should go on America's Got Talent, you're really good at jumping through hoops. :)

What the hell sort of Trump case do you think would go before the Supreme Court?  And, of course, you are saying ""her brain is shot"" because that is what Trump said.  

And not every election cycle has a boob running for President who doesn't know the job of the SC and says that he plans on appointing a justice who will prosecute Hillary Clinton.  They aren't a criminal court.  They couldn't prosecute somebody if they wanted to.  And Trump is so thin-skinned that as soon as somebody says anything negative about him he has a break down.  Presidential candidates get attacked ALL THE TIME.  Nobody has ever been so sensitive to this as Trump.  Fuckin Obama was called a secret Muslim terrorist and a documentary was made about how his mother was actually fucking some other guy who was his real father and he was a communist who shaped all of Obama's political views.

Yes, yes they do. And watch your language"
3049,"No, no they don't.  It's a decision of any judge in any court whether or not they will recuse themselves.  For example, Chief Justice William Rehnquist back in 2000 DIDN'T recuse himself from a case involving Microsoft antitrust laws even though his own son was a lawyer working on an antitrust case for Microsoft themselves.  He did not feel it was a conflict of interests enough that it would effect his decision.  The justices deal with the law.  They don't care about the people attached.  If a justice feels like they can interpret the law regardless of any connection to the case they don't need to recuse themselves... that is up to them.  Just because Ginsburg thinks Trump is an idiot doesn't mean she can't decide on a case that comes to the SC during a Trump presidency.  That's ridiculous.

* People spend more money and contribute the economy more

With many political observers and commentators wringing their hands about the failure of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to unite the country in the wake of police killings in both directions, your humble blogger has tried to argue that this is the wrong line of inquiry. (Never mind whether the country is even as divided as some of these observers say.) Instead, for the reasons I’ve tried to outline, we should be pointing out that one of the two candidates is actively trying to divide the country, while the other just isn’t.

Today the New York Times’s Nicholas Confessore weighs in with a massive, deeply reported piece that underscores the point as emphatically as one could wish for. Here’s the thesis:

    In countless collisions of color and creed, Donald J. Trump’s name evokes an easily understood message of racial hostility. Defying modern conventions of political civility and language, Mr. Trump has breached the boundaries that have long constrained Americans’ public discussion of race.

    Mr. Trump has attacked Mexicans as criminals. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. He has wondered aloud why the United States is not “letting people in from Europe.”

    His rallies vibrate with grievances that might otherwise be expressed in private: about “political correctness,” about the ranch house down the street overcrowded with day laborers, and about who is really to blame for the death of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. In a country where the wealthiest and most influential citizens are still mostly white, Mr. Trump is voicing the bewilderment and anger of whites who do not feel at all powerful or privileged.

    But in doing so, Mr. Trump has also opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century, according to those who track patterns of racial tension and antagonism in American life.

Read the whole piece for the full thrust of the argument, but for now, note this quote from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks hate groups: “I think what we really find troubling is the mainstreaming of these really offensive ideas. It’s allowed some of the worst ideas into the public conversation in ways we haven’t seen anything like in recent memory.” The piece’s ultimate conclusion is that Trump has made “the explicit assertion of white identity and grievance more widespread.”

[Five signs Trump’s campaign continues to fizzle]

What is really striking about all of this is that most observers, including neutral, non-ideological, and non-partisan ones, would not even quarrel with the idea that Trump is running a campaign that is explicitly about unleashing white backlash. For months, this has been widely, openly agreed upon by pretty much everyone who is paying even cursory attention. Yet oddly enough, this widely accepted acknowledgment of Trump’s explicit efforts to foment racial division is not being meaningfully brought to bear on the current debate over the two candidates’ responses to police-community tensions. (There are certainly exceptions to this; I’m talking generally here.) Clinton has repeatedly tried to acknowledge that the police and those protesting their use of force both have legitimate grievances; Trump has not done this to anywhere near the same degree.

By the way, Americans appear to agree that Trump is the far more divisive figure. A new Allstate/Atlantic Media/Heartland Monitor poll finds that Americans say by 48-30 that Clinton would do more to “bring the country together.” All of this is not to say that Clinton is not a polarizing figure in her own right. Rather, it is to say that, given the political conditions in this country, it is hard for one of the major party nominees not to be widely disliked by the other side; meanwhile, Trump is actively trying to foment and politically profit off of racial division in a way Clinton simply is not.

This morning brings new examples of this fundamental difference between the two candidates. Let’s hope that they help bring wider acknowledgment of that fundamental difference.

[Send us your best 2016 syllogisms!]

 * HILLARY TO SPEAK ON RACE: Clinton is set to speak today at the site of Lincoln’s “house divided” speech on the need to unify in the wake of police-community violence:

    Mrs. Clinton will expand on her remarks calling on white people to express more empathy with blacks who fear for their lives in encounters with the police. And she will reiterate her call for understanding about the difficult job police officers do, “kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to a dangerous job.”

In other words, Clinton will once again speak to grievances on both sides, as she has been doing. Meanwhile, Trump claims Black Lives Matter is inherently racist. Spot the difference there?

* THE QUOTE OF THE DAY, TRUMP-IS-A-UNITER EDITION: Talking Points Memo reports that Trump told Bill O’Reilly that unnamed people called for a “moment of silence” for the killer of five police officers in Dallas:

    “It’s getting more and more obvious and it’s very sad, very sad,” Trump went on. “When somebody called for a moment of silence to this maniac that shot the five police, you just see what’s going on. It’s a very, very sad situation.” There were no media reports about anyone calling for a moment of silence for gunman Micah Johnson.

Don’t worry, there’s plenty of video showing this happened, just like with the thousands and thousands of American Muslims who supposedly celebrated 9/11. The media is just suppressing it.

 * SANDERS TO ‘STUMP HEAVILY’ FOR CLINTON: In a new interview, Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager Jeff Weaver previews a very heavy campaigning schedule for him:

    “I think the senator’s intentions is to stump quite heavily for the secretary all across the country, obviously and specifically in the battleground states. In addition to that, he’ll be campaigning for down-ballot progressive Democrats in states all across the country — whether they are battlegrounds or not in battlegrounds. I think you are going to see a lot of Senator Sanders on the stump.”

Wait, so all of those people who told you that Sanders would destroy the Democratic Party before backing Clinton got it completely wrong?

* TRUMP WINNING IN FLORIDA AND PENNSYLVANIA? A new batch of Quinnipiac polls finds that Donald Trump is beating Hillary Clinton in Florida by 42-39 and in Pennsylania by 43-41, while it’s tied in Ohio at 41-41. But that would mean Clinton lost eight points of support in Florida from last month, while Trump gained three points — a huge swing.

Meanwhile, the Q-polls are out of sync with the polling averages, which have Clinton up by three in Florida, five in Pennsylvania, and three in Ohio. Stick to the averages, folks.

* CLINTON CAMP RESPONDS TO NEW POLLS: Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweets:

    We know the battlegrounds are going to be close til the end. That's why we need to keep working so hard. Trump is a serious danger, folks.

    — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) July 13, 2016

* NEW BATTLEGROUND POLLS COMING LATER TODAY: NBC’s Mark Murray teases that new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls of Iowa, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are coming at 5 p.m. today. These are good polls, so they should be taken seriously, but remember that the averages are the most important.

* CHATTER TURNS AGAINST WARREN AS VEEP: The New York Times reports that Elizabeth Warren has been invited to speak on the first night of the Democratic convention, which could mean that she will not be tapped as Clinton’s Veep candidate:

    Even Ms. Warren’s allies are now increasingly skeptical that she will join the ticket as the famously cautious Mrs. Clinton enjoys a steady lead in the polls over Donald J. Trump and is eyeing Democrats who are less dynamic than Ms. Warren but would not overshadow her on the campaign trail or in the White House.

Also, now that Bernie Sanders has offered a full throated endorsement of Clinton, which is likely to rally progressives, that might also tilt against picking Warren.

* SANDERS PROBABLY ISN’T IN VEEP MIX: Sanders said this morning on ABC News that the idea of tapping him as Veep “has not been raised yet.” That would appear to mean he is not being vetted, though anything is possible."
3129,"> Clinton: Rich vs poor class war

This is simply false."
3130,"It's the Republicans who seperate people by race, color, religion, creed, sexual orientation. Democrats want all Americans to be treated the same in the eyes of the law. Have any Democrats created bathroom laws about which groups can and can't go where? Is it Democrats who want to willy nilly fire people for having a non standard sexual orientation? Is it Democrats who want to exclude gays from the benefits of marriage? Is it Democrats who want to restrict women from appropriate medical care? Is it Democrats who want to, as the Republican candidate puts it, deport all the undocumented aliens in the country? Is it the Democrats who want to throw all the Muslims out? No, it's the Republicans who want to maintain the purity of white, Christianist America. You need to pay closer attention.

The reason the Democrats create protected groups is because the Republicans are intent on discriminating against these groups. If Republicans actually treated everyone equally under the law, the Democrats wouldn't need to single them out as protected. Republicans seperate Americans into groups to set group against group as a distraction while they fleece us left and right."

3137,">Sure, so in other words what you're saying is that Clinton will not engage in any meaningful sense of class warfare 

The rhetoric is class warfare. It enrages the people against the rich in a way that helps get her elected. Sanders was doing class warfare too, but at least he was honest and actually wanted to screw the rich. "
3138,"Well class warfare happens whether politicians use rhetoric that appeals to it or not. There's been a sort of economic war on the working class for decades (well really even before that, but in the modern incarnation) in this country."
3139,The criteria here is actively trying to divide the country. Fomenting class warfare qualifies because it attempts to divide the country on economic status. 
3140,"The country is divided on a class basis no matter what politicians say. This is the nature of a *class society*: politicians don't create these divisions, but the economic system does.

The only real way to overcome those divisions is to adopt a new system that isn't based on class."
3141,"Again, actively trying to divide. Pumping up the class divide is actively trying to divide. Guilty."
3142,"Well it's incorrect to say that a corporate backed candidate (Clinton) is actually trying to push for class divisions as you're claiming here. You're definitely overstating her class based rhetoric.

 But either way, you make it seem as if class conflict is some choice by politicians which is also false. It's just a quality of capitalism. The rhetoric of politicians is a *response* to the on the ground class conflict that has been going on since day 1 of this country."

3183,One way we could reduce the cost of medical care is take the profit out of it.
3184,You really don't want to discourage people from getting medical attention.  That is how you spread disease.
3185,"That would be the worst thing we could do. We should make health care a commodity that consumers can shop for and providers can compete in an open market. 

To this issue though, the first thing we need to do is close the borders, enforce existing immigration laws and stop providing free medical care for foreign citizens that is the responsibility of their own government."
3186,That's only a short-term solution and narrow look at the issue that ignores the bigger picture and exacerbates the spreading of disease. By allowing illegal aliens free medical services we enable and encourage more of them to abuse our health care system and further the spread of infectious diseases. In doing so we also permit foreign governments to ignore their own health care systems for their citizens. Had we addressed the open borders and welfare giveaways for illegals decades ago we'd have a better health care system in our own country and perhaps in foreign nations as well.
3187,"They will be here either way. If we cure their diseases, they won't bespreading them any more...."
3188,You're wrong. It's not the US government's responsibility to help sick citizens of other nations. It's their government's responsibility. If we close our borders and enforce existing laws then we limit the number of illegal aliens abusing our health care system and we force their government to improve theirs.
3189,American politicians have been using race to divide the lower-class forever. If they stand divided they can't organize to get effect policies to help the 99%. 
3190,Sadly the democrats created a race war to win elections.  More sad is that the Blacks fall for it.
3191,"The left deserves to lose for turning away from economic populism and towards movements like BLM. It's easier to sell economic populism to the average, everyday American than ""CHECK YOUR FUCKING PRIVILEGE!"""
3192,BLM is a terrorist organization
3193,"From the article

>For all the talk of racism, there has been a reckless inattention to the possibility that non-black citizens might have a boiling point too.

This is what concerns me.  BLM is campaigning on a lie, and now whites are being targeted for execution based on it.  This is not good to say the least.

As the article states, any reasonable protest movement would have taken a break after Dallas, but not BLM.  That's because they don't view Dallas as a big problem.  The American people aren't going to support that.  

What surprised me most about this article is 2/3 of black Americans support BLM?  WTF?  I thought it was a fringe extremist movement.  The media needs to do its fucking job, fast, or this is going to boil over in a very violent way."
3194,"Hillary's race war may be backfiring!  

Tired of the democrats and media trying to divide us"
3195, I am really amazed at Hillary and Obama hitching their wagons to these morons. Hillary especially. They more BLM is in the news the more her numbers will fall.
3196,Remember 1968. That's all I need to say about that. BLM terrorism is gonna elect Trump.
3197,"If protesting makes Trump win than that just means Americans really are as reactionary and bigoted as BLM says they are. Ironically this is an argument *for* protesting, not against it. "
3198,"They are right about the cops being racist, violent thugs but when they do shit like bully themselves into gay pride parades and go after stupid shit like that they look really bad."
3199,I think more of the blame should be set on the actual racists than the politicians who point it out and try to fix it. 
3200,"So you blame the Democrats instead of the racists? 

Or are you one of those, ""You're the true racist for calling other people racist"" types? "
3201,"The democrats don't have a choice. Black voter turnout was overwhelmingly high and white turnout extremely low in the last two presidential elections, and democrats did awful with the whites that did vote.

In other words, Democrats know that they have decidedly lost the white vote and the only reason Obama won was because of a combination of white apathy over McCain/Romney and non-white enthusiasm over Obama.

Democrats will need to somehow get non-whites to come out to for for Hillary at least as much as they did for Obama, while weathering the likely extremely high voter turnout of whites that are moved by Trump's populism and their desire to vote against Hillary."
3202,"It's weird how the right is so sensitive and easily offended by any mention of race. 

It's as if the word ""racism"" should come with a trigger warning for them because they completely shutdown at the mere mention of it possibly still existing. "

3204,"just because you're scared, doesn't mean they're attempting to terrorize you."
3205,"> BLM is campaigning on a lie

That's factually untrue. 

>and now whites are being targeted for execution based on it. 

Also not true. But if it were, then whites would know what problems minorities have been facing for decades and perhaps be more sympathetic toward their plight. Either that, or they'll get the precious race war The_Donald keeps hyping up and pushing for. "
3206,"Right, it's the democrats [trying to divide us](https://www.google.com/search?q=liberals+hate+america&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari). Not conservatives in any way whatsoever. /sarcasm"
3207,"Honest question, what's your definition of a race war? "
3208,Beating the shit out of cops & threatening to kill white people will get Trump elected. Hillary is a fucking idiot to keep egging it on. #TRUMP2016
3209,they aren't right about anything
3210, So every cop is a racist violent thug because vfc2000 says so. Sounds like you are a card carrying member of BLM.
3211,Being that the bar for racism is ever shifting and set so low the wrong skin color means you are born with it ending it isnt likely to happen.
3212,Who are the racists?  Black lives matter looks pretty racist to me.  I have never been a racist.  You?
3213,"Not at all.  We consider Clinton ongoing policies since 1992 to be racist.  We just don't like being falsly accused of being racists.  We like super predators just as much as the next guy.

Hillary's play book is using racism to divide the nation.  It is Hillary who is doing this.  "
3214,"But they look big and dark and scary. And a lot of them are seriously louder than I would want them to be.

75% of those shot had a weapon and were attacking an officer or civilian

60% were white

16% were non white hispanic

24% were black

BLM bitch is that the police dont run at a zero fault rate. Which is ridiculous in a 12 million employee industry that has dangerous environments. If factories cant do it how the fuck does the police do it when dealing with meth addicted highscool drop outs on withdrawl waving a gun around."
3216,"I am also tired of the republicans and their moral high ground on abortion and gay marriage.  So are a lot of us.  That is why Trump won!  I would never vote for Cruz.

Go Trump Go!

The democrats have wholly created the race war.

Democrats are also destroying the middle class through illegal immigration.  "
3217,"So in other words, yes, Americans are reactionary and bigoted? Alright, better keep protesting then. 

If Americans vote for Trump BLM is right about every single thing it says. As far as I'm concerned nothing is more legitimizing than this country running into the arms of a racist sociopath. "
3218,"Statistically and factually speaking they are. 

"
3219,"yeah yeah, you love cops.  Don't care."
3220,"Yeah, it's weird. Based on polls almost half of Trump supporters are racist. Yet I've never met one that openly admits it. You? "
3221,"> We just don't like being falsly accused of being racists. 

Yet you're perfectly fine doing it to others."
3222,look at all those racist facts

Also, protests =/= ""race war."" And it definitely is not fair to assign the causes of these protests wholly to either party."

3232,">you're going to insult people who are reacting to whites being targeted for murder?

3241,So if Trump loses does that mean SJW's will stop saying all white males regardless of how much privilege they have still have more privilege than everyone else?
3242,"> Americans believe the organizing principles of this country are capitalism, democracy and freedom. ... Since Americans have been told this since the crib, it must be true. Except, it's not. Since the creation of the republic, America's cultural, economic and political systems have rested upon one never-changing principle: white male privilege. 

Actually, both can be true, and are to some extent. 

America *was* founded on principles of capitalism, democracy and freedom (for white people, at first.) The white citizens started out with way more power and resources than other people. They passed those resources on to their mostly white children, who continue to have more power and resources.

3251,Good. Whites deserve to be the  minorities for once.
3252,"I have to ask though.  Why do people gravitate towards Trump, why is he the guy for white male privilege?  In my opinion, White males tend to vote Republican if you look at past elections.  Maybe Trump is just a stronger pull for that group because of his comments.  The Wall, the deportations.  Whites may not benefit directly but they think they will.

Politics is kind ""racial"" though, I know there was a surge of black voters that voted for Obama.  Of couse, they may still vote Democrat again in high numbers to avoid voting for Trump.

It would be nice if the general election wasn't so tied to the race angle."

3255,"> America's cultural, economic and political systems have rested upon one never-changing principle: white male privilege.

What is ""white, male privilege""? What is preventing other demographics from having the same ""privilege""?"
3256,"And more importantly, land and labor was expropriated from communities of color (Native American lands, chattel slave held blacks) for the benefit of the white community.  From that point on, any government program or social program was done to the **exclusion** of non-whites, things such as Union membership, military service, Federal funding for schools, funding for loans so whites could move to the suburbs and more."
3257,"You realize lots of white people came here with nothing right? Crammed on ships, starved, diseased and then lived in slums until they worked their way up.

Because he wants to take back America to a time where white male privilege was literally written into law. "

3278,Or the fact that the majority of blacks are killed by other blacks.  It is all the white man's fault.
3279,">What is preventing other demographics from having the same ""privilege""?

Sometimes the police by searching black people more often despite whites being more likely to be carrying contraband (as documented by the DOJ in the Ferguson report), or the justice system itself by applying harsher sentences for the same crime to black people.

Sometimes employers by discriminating against ""funny"" names, or the fact a black male is as likely to get a job as a white felon.

Or in school when teachers are more likely to more harshly punish black students compared to white students.

Or in housing where black people for decades were systematically prevented from buying houses outside certain areas.

For some examples."

This was a guy he had met previously. And Trump straight up said he had the best memory ever, yet turned around and claimed that he didn't remember the reporter or about his disabilities.

She committed no crime.  I don't feel the need to lambast her for it."
3513,What's your point? The fact is that Hillary has done something that would get most people indicted. The fact that she hasn't been indicted  implies there's something wrong.
3514,"She was recklessly incompetent and has consistently shown bad judgment in the handling of classified intelligence, not to mention that she lied to the American people repeatedly about almost every aspect of this case.  If you can't lambast her for this, what does she have to do in order to draw your scorn?"
3515,Actually she did something that would get nobody indicted.
3516,"What should I do exactly?  Protest against her?  Vote for Trump?

Are you saying it is a sexist issue? If that was the case then how do you explain seeing Jill Stein's name everywhere? Keep peddling that narrative though, I bet you wish the Greens were running a male candidate this year huh?"
3694,"I was saying reddit is dominated by white men and Trump polls very well with white men? Not sure why that was confusing. There are a hundred other threads to talk about Hillary's vast conspiracy to take over the world via poor IT policy, but it doesn't seem terribly pertinent to the question of why the Reddit experience doesn't necessarily reflect the general electorate."
3695,"Lying, violating the law but getting off because reasons, and being extremely careless all in order to avoid transparency and the FOIA anyway is not a partisan issue. Everyone should be angry at Hillary for this and they are all very justifiable reasons to not vote for her."

Even if everything you believed about Hillary Clinton was true, I'd still beat down the door to vote for her over an openly racist demagogue.  "
3697,"There are more than two choices regardless of whatever two party system argument anyone wants to make. If Clinton loses because millions of people exercise their democratic right and vote third party then that is on Clinton and the DNC for pushing her throughout the primary.

If Trump becomes the next POTUS then that is something that everyone who failed to vote in the primary or knowingly voted for one of the most polarizing candidates in history will have to live with. A result like that can't be called a blindside because this scenario has been described over and over and over again yet Democratic voters still selected poison. Its shocking really, this election was the Democrats to lose and they were given a godsend in the form of Trump but they decided to chose a lying criminal for some fucking reason, probably the only candidate who could actually potentially lose to him."
3698,"If you acknowledge that Donald Trump is running an openly racist campaign for President and if you aren't doing everything you can to stop that from happening... you might just be an overprivileged white dude.

Bernie Sanders has no problem understanding that, if you actually listen to the words he says about Donald Trump. "
3699,"And if you acknowledge that Hillary Clinton is an extremely careless lying criminal that jeopardized national security for her own personal gain and you are going to vote for her anyway... you might just be ethically bankrupt individual.

Shaming people into voting Clinton isn't going to work, you really should learn that lesson now if you want to salvage the situation and have any chance at winning. Many people have principles and won't vote for a criminal but I'm sure there are many more ideologues that could be convinced with things like universal healthcare and stronger climate change positions."

Its a state by state contest and the only states that matter are IO, CO, NC, VA, PA, OH, WV, FL with a few outliers that might flip OR, WA, KS, NJ, WI, MI. The rest of the country is going to vote how it has always voted with no surprises."

3724,"1) the time for their intent to be taken into consideration is at sentencing. although a prosecutor can choose not to press charges, and thats as it should be. i wouldn't want to live in a society where you could do bad things and plead stupid. I want parents to be able to avoid jail when they don't take their kids to the doctor because they believed prayer would save the child. stupid is not a defense.

2) what clinton did was intentional, deliberate, she lied repeatedly to the american public about it, and in one case she had a classified document altered to appear as if not classified. thats deliberate, so this entire argument (as stupid as it is) doesnt even apply here because she knew exactly what she was doing and went to great lengths to conceal it."
3725,">Not every potential federal defendant gets the benefit of such distinctions. Consider the retired racecar driver on a snowmobile outing in Colorado who got lost in a blizzard and unwittingly crossed into a National Forest Wilderness Area, the Native Alaskan trapper who sold 10 sea otters to a buyer he mistakenly believed was also a Native Alaskan, and the 11-year-old Virginia girl who rescued a baby woodpecker from her cat.

>The first two of these incidents resulted in misdemeanor and felony convictions, respectively, while the third led to a fine (later rescinded) and threats of prosecution.

Hillary refused to talk to the IG and Hillary did not make available all of her actual emails, as was reported by the FBI director yesterday.

This comparison is really no different than Republicans trying to compare the case of Petraeus to Hillary's even though they are quite a bit different.

The centrally controlled mainstream press is losing ad revenue because people have stopped going to sites that aggregate them.

None of this has anything to do with the job. It has to do with the person and Hillary has held office as a Senator and SoS. She supported going to war with Iraq. She supported attacking Assad. Hawk and has played the terrorism card. She lied about her intent regarding email putting freedom from FOIA ahead of national security.

3957,"So this is independent of Bernie's little speech. He asked for people to sign up to run in future races. About 7000 people responded (including me; I'll be running for state rep in 2018.)

Here in WA, we were organizing well before Bernie's speech because the filing deadline to run for office was back in May. I'm running for PCO, which is the entry level party officer position. Most of the 3500 here in WA are also running for PCO this year, but I personally know about a dozen folks running for state rep, state senator, or other offices (e.g. treasurer, governor) that come with a bit more external power. There are many more that I don't know campaigning for seats outside the Puget Sound area.

We'll see how many of us win this cycle, but to give you an idea in a typical year only ~800 people run for PCO. Most of us are running unopposed. And if we have several thousand Bernie-supporting PCOs we can essentially take over the state party from the bottom next year and install people who support our policy positions into the higher positions within the party structure. Then, in 2018, the party can throw its weight behind Berniecrats for other state offices, for congress, etc., rather than establishment Democrats.

>Most of the 3500 here in WA are also running for PCO this year,

Where is this 3500 number from and how many PCO positions are there? (Is a PCO the same as a [PCP](http://dpo.org/precinct-committee-persons)?)

>And if we have several thousand Bernie-supporting PCOs we can essentially take over the state party from the bottom next year and install people who support our policy positions into the higher positions within the party structure. 

That is great. That is how you get an actual grass roots ""revolution"", not by having a career politician run for the top office.

Which would be a relevant point at the beginning of the primary. 
"
3977,"I'm on my phone, so I'm not gonna multi quote but let me see if I can respond to each of your points in turn.

1) Sanders speech about the future of the political revolution included an exhortation to go to his site and sign up if you wanted to run for some office in the future. I signed up, as did about 7000 other people. The number there comes from Sanders' campaign. I can only speak to my personal dedication, but really this political thing has become my life for the past year or so and I've discovered that not only do I really enjoy it, I seem to be pretty good at it. I have the proper educational and professional background to be an effective legislator, and I'm already making connections with currently serving progressive state legislators who like me and have encouraged me to run. I'm also pretty heavily involved in one of our local congressional races, and the people I'm working with there are interested in helping out. I may not *win* in 2018, but I'll be damned if I don't at least try.

2) PCO and PCP are substantially equivalent offices. The 3500 number comes from an internal planning document that I'm not at liberty to share. There are 6600 precincts within WA state, but the huge majority of seats are typically go unfilled because it's not a glamorous job and there isn't (usually) a way to use it to exercise any kind of power. From what I was told at the state convention a few weeks back, typically only about 800 people statewide run for PCO. Per the party chair, this year represents a record number of filings for the office, and by looking at our internal documentation I know that pretty much everyone who filed this year is part of the movement.

3) Yup, this is the hard, unsexy work of actual political change. It would have been awesome to have Bernie in the White House helping lead the movement, but it doesn't really matter in the long run since it appears that his candidacy has inspired enough people to start fighting at the ground level. It only takes a few tens of thousands of citizens working in concert to actually influence the Party.

4) Of course, that's the nature of political parties. If they don't like your candidate the solution isn't to say the system is ""rigged"", it's to learn the rules and then use them to win by taking over from below. This year was all about that kind of learning.

That said, we want to make changes to our party that make it more inclusive and open; e.g. moving the state away from a caucus and into a primary, setting up universal registration, etc. We want to make the game more equitable for everyone."
3978,"I'll be happy to give you an update post-primary and post-election.

We have a primary in August that will see a fair number of showdowns between establishment dems and newcomer Berniecrats for state rep, state senator, US congress, state treasurer, state auditor, governor, and a few other offices.

In November, those individuals who won their primaries (and a few will win, based on current analysis) will be tested, and the elections for lower state office (i.e. PCO) will occur. The vast majority of the 3500 are PCO candidates, and most of us are running unopposed (myself included). 

The goal is to use overwhelming numbers of PCOs to rebuild the state party apparatus between now and 2018 so that the next wave of Berniecrats will have the support of the party for fundraising, organizing, etc.

2016 is early beta for this project. We're learning how to run campaigns, how to do outreach, how to do. . . well, *everything* one needs to do in order to mount a campaign. We'll lose most of the bigger races simply because we're new to this, and the movement has focused the bulk of its energy and attention on Bernie's race for president rather than local races. But we have years to come in which to apply the lessons learned in 2016, iterate, and try again. We'll do a bit better in 2018, even better in 2020, and so on.

I personally don't expect for us to get into a position to make meaningful changes to federal policy until 2024 or so. But we should be able to start making an impact in state politics by 2020 for sure, which is crucial because of the 2020 census and 2022 redistricting.

Like I said, long game vs short game."
3979,"Generally, I'm more inclined to believe the person on the ground and participating locally, than the person who questions that figure, asking for sources, while providing nothing to counter what is -- at present -- the more credible claim."
3980,"The subject is whether or not Sanders squandered his ""leverage"" with the Party by not conceding.

My contention is that he hasn't squandered anything because there was nothing *to* squander. As soon as he failed to win the delegate race, he was destined for marginalization within the Party power structure; any leverage he had was illusory and related to meaningless platform points.

Sanders' actual power lies with his ability to motivate a core of activated, engaged citizens who have decided that taking a passive role in government will no longer cut it. Those individuals (I'm one of them, and there are tens of thousands of others like me out there) are going to be pursuing office in 2018 and 2020 with the goal of changing the Party from the bottom up. 

I can only speak with any authority about what's happening here in Washington, but the news coming out of other conventions in states where Bernie won is telling: people are committed to the very hard work that is reforming a major political party from the inside.

The internet being tone-deaf as it is, I took your phrasing to be somewhat attack-oriented in their questioning of the other person's statement.  Seeing as how u/noxylophone seemed to be talking from personal experience (ie his own dealings and perspective of things, on the ground in WA), I would have considered him a credible source until he wasn't (to borrow that old, no-content adage).  In such a situation, since you seemed to be the one refuting his own personal claim, I put the onus on you to disprove him, or at least provide counter-facts which demonstrate your position and where you're coming from to distrust his figures.

BTW, in case anyone thinks that given what happened to the Pound now would be a good time to short the US dollar, remember that we've already seen that when the establishment suddenly realizes that ""the thing they were all trying to pretend could not happen is now actually happening"" they largely tend to react by pouring all their liquid cash straight into US treasuries and US dollars ... even when the calamity in question is largely the result of the mass delusion, dysfunction and distraction going on in Washington DC. What would happen this time? I've no idea.

I'm sure the company they work for will get paid for all the Shilling until someone from the Campaign calls them and cancels their contract.

4090,"Before the Sanders supporters co-opted the ""rigged voting machines"" conspiracy theory, that was often employed by the left against the right.

This isn't a republican conspiracy.  Its reality.  "
4092,"I agree but just because charges aren't brought doesn't mean it can't be a scandal. Honestly, just from the information we already know about this server, it already it's a legit scandal."
4093,"I'm not a person who has ever called her a criminal, and assuming she doesn't become a criminal I never will.

But at the beginning of this cycle I assumed I would vote for her in November. Among other things, the developments involving her private email server, and her decisions and public statements regarding the controversy, have brought her integrity into question enough that I no longer assume I will vote for her.

You essentially said there were two types of people: those who were always going to vote for her and those who call her a criminal. I'm informing you that I was going to vote for her, likely will not now, and will not call her a criminal unless she becomes so under its legal definition. Just responding to your comment."
4094,"Do you need Cheney himself to tell you he knew Hussein didn't have WMDs, before you'll believe it's true?

Some things are naturally tried in the court of public opinion, and the person's character and past behavior is taken into opinion before drawing conclusions.

Then there are the loyalists who will only consider wrongdoing happened when there is conclusive proof out in the open for all to see. 

If you think you or I are ever going to get the unfiltered truth about this situation, I've got some land on the water in Florida I'd like to sell you. Until then you're going to take Clinton on her word, and for reasons I mentioned in my first post I'm not going to spend all that long trying to change your opinion on it."
4095,"I am not scandalized by the idea that an organization the size of the US Department of State had crappy IT services and procedures. 

Somehow, that isn't at all surprising."
4096,"So assuming the FBI comes back with a decision that no crime was committed, you're not going to vote for her because she didn't respond correctly to inaccurate claims about her breaking the law.

I see. Makes total sense."
4097,"Really?  You don't have to eat the shit she feeds you... Seriously, you can admit she was wrong about things and still like her and support her.  "
4098,"It doesn't have to rise to criminality for the infractions to be highly unethical and the behavior to be dangerous. Especially for a commander in chief. Further, how a person responds to criticisms of their unethical behavior can also be taken into account when casting a vote. 

And I didn't say this is the only reason, but there are other elements of her behavior that cast doubts on her integrity for me, and appear to be patterns of behavior.

Further, you know damn well that an acquittal or a lack of indictment doesn't mean a lack of wrongdoing. It can mean many things including lack of strong enough evidence to produce a likely conviction. Did you notice in the JW case how all of Clinton's aides have the same lawyers which basically guarantees that they can all get their stories straight? Things like very strong representation can work wonders for concealing evidence. Like having all your lawyers decide what are ""personal"" emails and then we find out they threw out emails pertinent exactly to the matter at hand.

There are tons of people who think OJ did it even though he was acquitted. There are tons of people who think he didn't do it and wouldn't change their minds even if he had been convicted. There are even those who would say he should've been acquitted even if he did do it. Some people think his robbery sentence was his comeuppance for being acquitted for a crime he obviously committed! Who do you think is right?

Clinton is already guilty of some of these things in the eyes of many, many people. Many in this country are distrustful of power and how it enables people to do wrong and get away with it. And many people believe she's powerful enough to avoid prosecution no matter what."
4099,"And also, I used this analogy elsewhere, but do you need Cheney, Bush or other members of the administration to be convicted of crimes before you believe they were committed? Or are we applying different standards to democrats and republicans? As a democrat this is what has been killing me about my democrat friends. Two sets of rules depending on whose team you're playing for."
4100,"Again, it really doesn't matter that she broke no laws to some people. They just won't vote for her because."
4101,"Look at the silence by democrats the last 8 years.  Obama ran on a platform of ending the war and shutting down gitmo.  In reality he expanded the war and is more militaristic than Bush ever was.  His torture policies are war crimes-Bush took ""terrorists"" on planes and took them elsewhere to torture them.  Obama just kills people, suspected terrorists.  

He's pro israel and refuses to recognize the israel settlements as illegal and war crimes.

He's vaporized thousands of innocent people as a result of drones.

He spied on all of us via NSA and warrantless wiretapping.  

He did nothing to hold those responsible for the Great Recession responsible.  In fact he bailed them out.  No banker has faced any punishment.  

He's made the US less safe as a result of his drone program which is a war crime.  

Gitmo is still in existence.  

Has done shit all to end the environmental crisis.  

He's possibly the worst president ever in terms of civil liberties.

What has he done?

He's a war criminal and should be prosecuted as such.  "

4150,">Sure if you want to loose your sovereignty.

And gain the benefit of unhinged trade across some of the wealthiest markets on the planet.

Let's not pretend like joining the EU doesn't have tremendous economic benefits. Yes, you do give up a modicum of authority in terms of your domestic policy, but it's not for nothing. And there are lots of countries, and large swaths of the electorate, who believe that the trade off is worth while. You may disagree that it's worthwhile if you value absolute sovereignty over all else, and I'm not dismissing your beliefs on the matter, but you don't get to naively *and fallaciously* pretend like the economic pros aren't there.

>Yeah because that large single market economy and the Euro worked out so well for the Greece.

What's hurting Greece isn't the EU. It's the Eurozone. Or more specifically, it's the fact that they're in a monetary union that lacks the fiscal transfers required to offset the inevitable trade deficits.

UK is not in the same boat, because the UK is not in the Eurozone. They have the unique and *great* position of enjoying all the benefits of unhinged trade in the wealthiest markets without losing the monetary levers of their own fiat currency. If they give it up now, but want to be back in the EU later for all its benefits, it's highly unlikely that the rest of the EU is going to allow them to dodge the Eurozone a second time. Food for thought.

>Terrible and uninformed piece, that does little if anything to explain the situation.

Yes. It's a terrible and uninformed piece. One which you have responded to with an equally terrible and uninformed comment."
4151,[deleted]
4152,">But it's not unhinged. There are EU regs to follow.

Figure of speech.

There aren't the usual taxes, tariffs and customs in trading between EU members. Of course what's being sold is subject to a common set of regulations (most of which would be in place even if the countries were not EU members), but the *movement* of what's being sold occurs as if there are no borders.

>Now? Well let's see you have to join the Euro if you join the EU. So take that on it's face value.

We're discussing the UK and the Brexit. UK has a special position of being an EU member without being part of the Eurozone. So it's reaping benefits above and beyond what other countries reap.

>And they took on a load of debt from the Germans and European Central Bank.

I don't think you understood what I was talking about.

Normally, when a country like Greece that does not have a strong domestic production trades with a country like Germany that does, there's a deficit for Greece that causes debt. 

If Greece had its own currency, they could devalue it to shrink the debt and motivate foreign investments, which would strengthen the domestic product. But the Eurozone takes this lever away from them.

The same kind of deficit occurs between different US states here under the monetary union of the US Dollar. What's different is that the US also has a system of fiscal transfers, by way of the federal government collecting taxes in one state and spending them on social services in another. These fiscal transfers offset the deficits (and debt) that importing states incur against exporting states under the monetary union.

Since the Eurozone lacks this kind of a fiscal transfer, you end up with Greece under a mountain of debt. And since they cannot pay it off, the EU is forced to periodically forgive or reduce Greece's debt. In other words, the circumstances *force* on the EU a certain kind of very inefficient fiscal transfer mechanism via debt forgiveness. But Greece suffers in the meantime.

I didn't go into great detail in my last post, but the notion of Greece incurring debt was already baked into my description of trade deficits. So what point do you have in bringing this up?

The point that *I* had is that none of this is applicable to the UK, because the UK is not in the Eurozone. They're enjoying all the trade benefits of the EU without suffering any of the loss of monetary levers. That's a fantastic position to be in. Leaving the EU is a really really really bad idea for the UK, because if they do, they're never getting this unique status back.

>Yet... how much further will the EU push for ever tighter fiscal and policy union?

They should push a LOT further, actually. See above, regarding how the Eurozone really desperately needs a true mechanism of fiscal transfers (i.e.: tax in Germany, spend in Greece) in order to make the monetary union functional. If they don't push that far, the story of Greece will repeat over and over again with every periphery economy that incurs deficits against export monsters like Germany and France.

Usually at this point the question is asked: what does France and Germany get out of paying taxes that are spent on Greece?

They get stable markets full of consumers that can actually afford to buy their goods. Furthermore, if it wasn't for the periphery economies, France and Germany being export leaders would have increased the value of Euro, making it harder for them to sell their goods outside of EU markets. As it stands, the periphery suppresses the value of the Euro, allowing their domestic production to compete much more easily abroad.

Which is to say that France and Germany actually benefit a LOT from the Eurozone. So maybe it's time they started paying their dues to the periphery that they've thus far been exploiting, eh?

>Which the electorate decided against the tradeoff.

Sure, in the UK. And they have every right to.

I'm just pointing out that the people and the electorate elsewhere don't share these sentiments. There are lots of reasons to stay in the EU. Your ultra-nationalist ideologies over sovereignty aren't some absolute universal truth that everyone should follow.

>The EU is pushing for them to be over quickly and Article 50 to be triggered quickly. I imagine this is because there are quite a few general elections coming up in 2017.

It has nothing to do with elections in 2017.

It has everything to do with the markets going haywire. There's a great deal of uncertainty right now. UK needs to take action *one way or the other* quickly, so that the markets can see what the future will be, and then bake in the cost into the prices instead of riding insane spikes and pitfalls for months.

Honestly, what did you think was going to happen to the finance world when UK voted to leave?

4265,"I googled it. That party doesn't exist. There is, however, a party named the Democratic Party. Is that who you meant? "
4266,"Yep. He is appealing to populists. Strangely, Trump mirrors the Barry Goldwater campaign. Goldwater knew that his extremism and his opposition of the 1964 Civil Rights was going to affect the electoral college and popular vote. Goldwater was just as incoherent on civil rights as Trump is on trade. Claimed he isn't a racist, but wanted to allow private businesses to right to discriminate. He took a conservative position held by a large southern portion of the Democratic Party and applied it to the Republican Base for southern votes. It worked for Nixon. History will determine if Trump's effect will work for future election. He is taking a liberal position and applying it to the Republican Party."
4267,"tRump hates workers, but is protecting them with this position so he obviously don't know what he is doing."
4268,What crazy times. The Republicans have really fractured. The only thing keeping them together is their partisanship. 
4269,"My concern with Trump isn't even his stated positions, it's that he doesn't seem to have a clear understanding of any of them. I think he's just picking the parts that he knows will get cheers from the crowd, but isn't subscribing to any coherent economic theory. You might not be a fan of, say, Ronald Reagan, but I always thought he was a supply side true believer. He wasn't just throwing shit out there, he believed in the system. "
4270,He supports the workers with his position but he hates us which proves he is stupid.
4271,Nope. Just incoherent.
4272,"No, he wants everyone that isn't an old rich white man to starve."
4273,">""...He's incapable of understanding that trade negotiations are a win-win for all parties, that the US is better off if these other countries are also doing well.""

Umm, fuck you very much. No reasonable observer believes your bullshit anymore.  Enriching Rapacious, degenerate gamblers of the banking establishment, while the streets of our major cities are lined with people living in tents, is not ""win-win""
"
4274,">History will determine if Trump's effect will work for future election. He is taking a liberal position and applying it to the Republican Party.

One of Goldwater's biggest achievements was getting a generation of conservatives to actually organize and make networks so they could continue to influence politics after he lost.  The thing about comparisons to Trump is that Trump has no such organization or political machine.  Trump is a one man show, running a highly unconventional campaign based off of media manipulation.

Not to mention, Sanders has similar thoughts on free trade, so it's not like Trump can just take votes from the Democratic party unapposed - it may work in this election, but down the road there is equal precedent for an anti-free trade Democratic candidate.

I like the analysis though.  So weird that Goldwater is relevant again, I just picked up ""Before the Storm""."

>During the campaign for President in 1928, Hoover promised to help the farmers who were not sharing in the prosperity of the nation.[Nor were a lot of people] Hoover signed the Smooth-Hawley Bill which put a tax on farm imports. [And 900 goods in  total]  The tariffs damaged the United States’ foreign trade and led to the depression.

"
4276,"Yep. Of course, parties have been fractured throughout their history and regained power through new coalitions."
4277,"After the total failure of Hoover's tariffs and the Great depression, Roosevelt ended the tariffs, and Republicans too forever swore off the idea of prohibitive tariffs. 

In accordance with the New York State Education Board of Regents, when Trump was  a high school student he was supposed to study this.  And he was supposed to learn that building barriers to trade causes huge and rapid loss of GDP as was illustrated in the American History book used during his junior year, in 1962-63.
"
4278,"Reagan was at least at first coherently convinced that trickle down also coined as ""supply side"" would work.    When trickle down resulted in over 10% unemployment, he turned to Tip O'Neil to get him out of trouble.

George H. W. Bush called Trickle down ""Voo Doo.""  He however believed at first in the mythology that ""war ends recession"" an unfortunate belief which GHW Bush soon found out didn't work as unemployment went to 10% again and didn't come down.  So he did what he knew had to be done.  He raised taxes.  (Trickle down is the same as low taxes on the rich).  George H. W. Bush had great success from raising taxes as shown by the economic response during 1993 (the effect of a presidents policy is realistically measured from October to October - not ""Jan 20 to Jan 20).  This plus economic stimulus led to a very good upsurge in the economy and 3.8% unemployment.

Bush's son, George W. Bush once again embraced trickle-down. America lost 6 million manufacturing jobs and at the end, unemployment again went to 10%.  Following George W. Bush's failure, some Republicans apparently formed a group who called themselves ""neo-liberals"" (I found out about this recently) who believed that it was justified to raise taxes.

Trump despite his inarticulate incoherence has bought into the same trickle-down that W used and failed with.

Not that anything happened, but worthy of jail to many. Few note how little controversial is found in her email---for someone supposedly so corrupt it sure seems free of it.

Clinton foundation....as most faux scandals go it's largely innuendo.  There is a donor who was put on an advisory board...but it turns out the guy is knowledgeable about cybersecurity. Whispers of a Russian oil company who donated to the foundation and later was approved to buy an American  Canadian company. Absent are all the details that matter....did Hillary lobby for them?  Did she do it for money.... if so show it. For a giant worldwide philanthropy you're going to have unsavory people donating, youll have to cut deals with governments that aren't the best (or they probably wouldn't need help to begin with). And the work being done and donors giving money are almost certainly going to have some dealings with our state department...that can't be surprising.

4413,Trump eats KFC with fork = news for Hillary supporters
4414,">which she has received two vaccines for

That's not how that works. You can't receive a vaccine against an entire class of infection. "
4415,I think you can buy a pneumonia vaccine from the same guy selling the Brooklyn Bridge at a discount.
4416,"Right... I'm sure you find it quite ""worrying"" and you are genuinely concerned about her health and aren't just bringing this up to feed into ridiculous conspiracy theories."
4417,I'm worried Donald Trump is a coke addict. Sniff.
4418,That's it. Lash out in your impotence. \_(ツ)_/¯

4420,Why did Donnie sniff sniff sniff sniff and send that tweet out in the middle of the night? 
4421,That's some first class scattershot bullshit you have there.   
4422,"The Bush administration drummed up the war to Iraq and it was supported overwhelmingly at the time.  She has said time and time again she regrets it every day.  Trump was in support of it as well.  She took donations from individuals in Saudi Arabia, not the government and the people she took money from are trying to reform their country to ease away from the overly conservative government they have now.  Trump has also done business in SA as well as in other Middle East countries.  Trump also has worked with shady characters, such as the mafia and large scale drug dealers. "
4423,"He's a true blue-collar billionaire who fights for the people. He eats KFC with a knife and fork on his private jet, just like you! "
4424,And is up at 3am tweeting and sniff sniff sniff during the debates. Makes you wonder why he won't release those tax returns. 
4425,And you don't get two vaccines. 
4426,"Yea, but you can get a vaccine against its most likely bacterial cause. Pneumovax.

Streptococcus pnumoniae is the leading cause of Pneumonia (and otitis media, meningitis, and sinusitis)"

4428,It's called pneumovax look it up.

4432,"Hey *cough cough cough cough* *gasp* *cough cough cough*


*faints*"
4433,"Well pneumonia isn't a single germ. It can be caused by many bacteria, viruses, or even fungi. That vaccine prevents only one bacteria form.

Source: I looked it up. 
"
4434,"Those are vaccines to prevent against a particular bacteria, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Yes, that bacteria can sometimes cause pneumonia, as can many other diseases. To call them pneumonia vaccines is like calling the measles vaccine a fever vaccine."
4435,How about a drug addict who won't release his tax returns?
4436,Like FDR sick or JFK sick?
4437,Aren't you concerned he's a drug user?
4438,"But Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of pneumonia, did you look that up?

It would usually take a compromised immune system or pulmonary issues to get the rarer causes."
4439,Strep pneumo is number 1 cause of pneumonia.
4440,"He's not. But Hillary needs plenty of Rx just to barely function.

Doesn't it bother you that Hillary Clinton and her husband single handedly destroyed any chance of Haiti rebuilding after the quake?"
4441,"Well 30% of cases are viral so you're now splitting 70 percent with all other bacterial causes and fungi. Throw in the vaccines being between 71 and 93% effective and you got yourself a pretty big margin of error. 

Ps: the vaccines are usually done in 3-4 doses so ""recieving two vaccines"" would be the low end of the spectrum. 

We can google fight all day though, point is you are driving an agenda and playing up some conspiracy theories as your own concerns. "
4442,"Oh, if we can conclude that it was definitely one of causes #2-#50 that gave her pneumonia, well shit I don't see how anyone can vote for her knowing that."

4461,"I am not super-enthused about either Brexit or Trump. In fact, I might even go so far as to call them ""mistakes."" But they are democratic results; people voted and they happened. 

I am uncomfortable with the article's implications. Sure, if 50%+1 voted to execute a holocaust, it would be a massive tragedy that should be avoided. But where is the line for the ""the rational people"" stepping in, both in terms of the severity of the tragedy and the agreement of the public? Also, who are the ""rational people""? Likely, the authors of the article feel that they are in that group. But who makes the standard of who is rational? Clearly the ~52% of people voting Leave in the UK thought that their position was more rational than voting Remain (this is briefly ignoring protest votes, which is much more complicated). Yes, it stinks to find out you are in the minority on something, but the response shouldn't then be to throw out the system where you are the minority. Make a case to the world, show your position, and be a positive member of the system you participate in. If the problem is misinformed voters, inform them instead of just calling them misinformed.

Democracies do make mistakes, but that's the price you pay for the preservation of your rights as a civil society. "
4462,"Well, every few years or decades the masses are allowed to make a decision. Of course they are not prepared for it.

This is more a continuous failure of the ruling elite to listen to the people.

Participation in government policy and decision making must become an every day and normal thing. Then we can get rid of ruling elites, and that disconnect between the rulers and the ruled can't happen. The technology to implement that is there for a few years now. What's lacking is the social will and awareness.

According to whom?

> People who know

Ahh.

Look, it's not like designing a rocket to go to the moon. Democracy would be a terrible vehicle to make those types of decisions.
But who else can decide what are the best policy settings for a country other than its inhabitants?
Where is it legislated that a country must have x% economic growth, at certain costs and tradeoffs? Why is it x%? Why not make it 2x, by getting rid of rules and regulations? Why not make it 3x by getting rid of the 40 hour week? Why not make it 5x, by targeting a 20% net immigration every year? What is the right level of immigration anyway?

All of these things are decisions eminently the domain of a country's citizens. The backlash of the elites to a decision that might shave a couple points of economic growth in the short to medium term is indicative of the obsessive level of control they expect to exert over society. It's not a bad thing for the governing elites to be given a shock every now and then. "
4468,"If the Brits made a wrong decision it was because no other decision was available to them which would address their concerns.

For decades politicians in power have used these boogiemen to either justify doing unpopular things or as proof as to an outside influence that is causing the problem that is outside of their control.  They told the public how these monsters were responsible for all of their problems.  But now, after telling us how big of an issue these boogeymen are for decades, they are shocked that people arguing that they would support radical decisions to tackle these problems.  I don't understand people's surprise over this.  It is the natural progression of the path we have been on for quite some time."

We have stooped down to operating like poor nations and lost much.

Very short sighted and ignorant and willing to make themselves suffer even more just to hurt others a bit. I guess sometimes the masses really do the wrong thing, it's scary to think so many of you think it's appropriate.

4489,"> I wouldn't want unelected, foreign bureaucrats creating and implementing laws in my country. And apparently neither did the British.

Except for the quickly onsetting reality the day after voting that a lot of people *didn't know what they were voting for*.

Even beyond all the lies, there are many people who thought that the referendum being nonbinding meant that voting to leave was a negotiation tactic. The people of the UK would make their frustration known, and a better arrangement would happen with the EU. Now there will be no arrangement."
4490,You use a super majority.
4491,"Remember, the requirement for a super majority to make fundamental constitutional changes in the US is antiquated and harmful except when it comes to issues the ""living document"" crown disagrees with."

I think most of the people understood this is going to be rough in the UK for a while, or they should understand that by now, but they will recover, and things will get better. They, and everyone else shouldn't be discouraged by the immediate changes. They are a sovereign state, and still have allies and trade agreements, and will create or buy what they need. Now its just the media trying to instill all this fear in people."
4498,"A lot of people comprehend the mentality of low information voters who are angry without knowing where to place their blame. The article touches on that. 

But yeah, that's how mobs form. A lot of angry people doing ""their best to make you suffer."" And as the article points out, there is a reason they're not usually successful in their ultimate long-term goals. "

I may be mistaken so I am sorry if that's the case."
4506,"I agree that this was probably the best ""solution"" to the Brexit issue. Such a drastic change should require a larger constituency than just 50%+1. 

I think the reason that Brexit came about was some confusion about what the vote actually meant to both the people voting and the country's leadership. (The vote and the activation of article 50 being separate events, for example) It was such a complex event that a one-time up-or-down vote created bizarre coalitions that carried the event across the line."
4507,Mostly because that vote failed.
4508,It would have been nice to just settle with a vote back then.

Even with them blocking him let's not forget he killed 2 or 3 terrorists / tyrants. I happen to think he was a great president aside from the fact that he hasn't done much recently about the terrorism problem. Also it's dumb to say oh the masses. There's a reason we have elections. The people chose him as a leader. The masses didn't fail anything. They made their choices. Also he has nothing to do with Brexit. Brexit is between the U.K. and EU.

But good god, does the existence of pretentious Social Justice Warriors make them, in any way, incorrect? Should we not be more open and multicultural as a people?

And yeah, there's even hatred for white people mixed in. I hate a lot of white people as a white man. But there's no fundamental difference between those in power. Theres a lot of white hatred cause a lot of white people are the ones in power at present. 

Do you understand where that comes from? Or do you simply hate it because you're white?

Massive Orwellian super-states eh? So we never grow more interconnected because people will try to take advantage of it? That will ALWAYS happen.

But ideas and people will spread better in a more open society, which will result in more pushback against those attempts.

Because it's not like individual states aren't already going Orwellian in their monitoring.

4527,Ok whatever. Like I said I really don't care. It's still the dumbest insult I've ever heard.

I've seen far more sexism from her campaign, surrogates, and supporters than I ever have from the Sanders side. They have gender politics on the brain so try to classify everything that way (which results in a lot of sexism, unsurprisingly).    "

""I can't think of anything more outsider than being the first woman president""

""If you're voting based on merits, one merit is that I am a woman!""

""Who could be more of an outsider than the first woman president""

""I wouldn't be a third Obama term because being a woman president would be quite a change""

""And I could be the youngest.. woman to be president""

4574,David Daleiden is going to be convicted on a number of charges.  He's going to continue to lie.
4575,Fucking liars.
4576,"Did you read the article? The House committee investigating the issue found gross violations of federal law HIPAA with respect to how StemExpress and PP collaborated on organ harvesting. Identifiable patient data is protected by law, and cannot be shared under anything besides strict need-to-know, for the benefit and with the consent of the patient conditions."
4577,"One was already dropped, and the other will either be dropped or defeated in court. Under cover investigations are protected by the First Amendment. Hopefully with this latest revelation of federal lawbreaking by PP and their partners the focus will be back on the crimes and not the messengers."

I'm sure PP, their partners and supporters can come up with something better than ""don't believe your lying eyes."" I mean, surely there is some explanation for why a for profit company should be granted access to confidential medical records and the patients themselves not for any benefit of the patient but instead to further enrich the for profit company and PP. I'll be waiting."
4583,"Your claim might make more sense if there were some kind of motive other than exposing criminal activity. Press freedoms in this country under the First Amendment protect these sorts of investigations even when you like the target and think they're great. And when lawbreaking is discovered as seen here and elsewhere, the reason for protecting the press in these cases is clear. Sometimes we need some covert activity to expose the truth."
4584,"If there was any indication that such sharing actually happened, it might. There is no credible evidence that any such thing happened. Just the word of a sleazy hit piece author and a rabid anti choice representative out to smear the reputation of PP."
4585,The press want involved in this case. 
4586,"If that's all we had here, then there would be no need for a formal Congressional complaint. The evidence of [HIPAA violations](https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/114/letters/20160603HIPAA.pdf) is clear. That's an 83 page pdf, but you can get the gist from the first two if you don't want to read it all. Again I wonder how your response would be different if, I dunno, Pfizer were, in the interest of increasing their own profits, granted direct access to patient records by a hospital where a patient was receiving care. It's not ok in that case either. In fact, it's against the law. No amount of PP tweets or press releases can change that. It's time for the federal government to act."
4587,"Well, certainly it's true the press has a pro PP bias, but I wouldn't say they weren't involved. They were happy to take whatever PP said at face value and then do their part to bury these revelations as quickly as possible."
4588,"I'm sure that you think that is true, but it isn't. You are allowing your hatred of PP to obstruct your view of reality. No laws were violated. We have had dozens of investigations done by people who absolutely hate PP, and none of them have been able to come up with a single violation."
4589,"I'm saying the undercover people weren't press and wouldn't qualify for press protections.   They are committing fraud, identity theft."
4590,That's not a response. You need to address the specific charges (flagrant HIPAA violations). Pretending there's not an elephant in the room doesn't actually make the elephant go away.

Some terrorists were very religious Muslims and some barely practicing... according to MI5, the predictive power of every factor is very low — other than: Is a Muslim.

4689,"I have always felt that a democratic republic based around the Dunbar number would be the only way to successfully curb the flaws with proper representation in our current system.

This article really plays to that point as well, lawyers are so far removed from common people that they tend to have absolutely no care for them, and without that care, they cannot even begin to understand the day to day issues that common people face.

To put what I am saying in perspective, the scientific truth about humans is we can care, at maximum, for between 100 to 250 people.  On average it is about 148, which is commonly rounded up to 150.  In order for someone to actually understand your problems, they need to care about them.

The TL;DR of this is, for a nation with 320 million people, we would need 2,133,333 representatives.  Yes.  Over two million representatives.  To make it more complex, these representatives would have to separate groups of 150 people they care for, so that no person is represented twice."
4690,"> The chart above comes from Stanford political scientist Adam Bonica. The correlation is astounding. The higher the share of lawyers in a national legislature, the more unequal the society. And the US is an extreme outlier on both axes.

Because legal institutions are highly resistant to change and are instruments of formalizing the status quo. This isn't about rich lawyer parasites siphoning money from everyone else. It's about them getting in the way of society's self-correcting mechanisms.

Read Dickens's *Bleak House* to see what happens when the legal system rather than serving humans becomes an end in itself."

>The higher the share of lawyers in a national legislature, the more unequal the society. And the US is an extreme outlier on both axes.

Correlation =! Causation

To add to that, the proposal to fix this 'problem' is also pretty terrible.

The professor proposes a political scholarship of sorts, from either corporations or politics itself, drawing analogies to higher education a while back, when not many could get in. The problem with this is that its not congresses job to reduce lawyers from congress, and its pretty damn entitled to think that corporations should fund political campaigns just to get equality in congress. Higher education is increasingly becoming a neccesity, a career in congress isn't."

Anyway, your post title is misguided. More lax firearm laws may or may not lead to fewer deaths from mass shootings, but a single incident doesn't prove anything one way or the other. You can always find individual instances where access to firearms prevented a homicide, and you can always find individual instances where access to firearms *enabled* a homicide.

The question is which policy – laxer gun laws, or stricter gun laws – leads to fewer homicides *overall*. (Obviously the actual debate is a lot more complex than ""lax"" vs. ""strict"", but you see my point.)

[Good for the environment](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/g161/top-10-myths-about-natural-gas-drilling-6386593/) in that it produces clean natural gas, a far better fossil fuel than the alternatives. Bad for the environment in that it uses water, can contaminate ground water, and releases methane through leakage during drilling.

[Good for the economy is indisputable.](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2015/03/economic-benefits-of-fracking) Fracking has dropped consumer gas prices by $13B per year from 2007-13, allowing the US to spend less on energy and put more money into savings or into the economy. Natural gas prices are half of what they would be otherwise.

Fracking is also good for our foreign policy and national defense, as we're less reliant on importing foreign energy and can build our own reserves more reliably. [Imports of foreign oil have dropped 35% since 2006.](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mttimus1&f=m)

Ultimately fracking deserves more research, more oversight and stricter controls, and should be seen as a low cost energy source that keeps our nation self sufficient while we bridge the gap between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.

5124,"People will believe LITERALLY ANYTHING the media tells them. That's why so many people believe that 19 saudi hijackers crashed two planes into the WTC, even though it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for it to have happened that way.

911 was a cheap magic trick: the Israelis blew holes in the WTC using explosives, then used CG to add planes to the footage taken of the explosions.

Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw

This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0

You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg

The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc

But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&feature=endscreen&NR=1

These explosives were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site. They even made a book about their ""art"" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207

Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report

Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.

They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw

According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q

WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY

Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/

Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ

The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I

Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579

Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the ""art students"":

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html

Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, ""it's good for Israel"".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUbTe50UUgM

The only way that America will improve is if people actually get a real education (not college indoctrination) and start reexamining history and the treasonous politicians that are destroying their country."

The stand your ground defense may apply and permit a victim to brandish or use a firearm, depending on state law, in the following situations:

Beyond the house. If a person is confronted in his vehicle or on his residential property including the driveway, swimming pool area, or land around the home, he may respond with a firearm.
A public place. If an aggressor uses force or threatens violence against another in a public place, the person being attacked or threatened has no duty to choose an apparent safe way to retreat, and may instead use the amount of reasonable force necessary to fend off the attacker.""

This type of reaction and belief that everyone is trying to hurt you is why so many people die to gun violence (both from the police and from citizens.) I personally believe threat assessment and keeping level-headed need to be training points and factors into whether an individual can purchase a gun. Obviously the argument can be made about unrealistic standards and not being able to prepare for every moment, but this seems like the sort of thing a reasonable person should be able to recognize as ""not life threatening"" very quickly."

Yep.  They were acting in a manner that is already frowned upon (legally) in society, so it is easily arguable that he had no idea what depths of depravity they were capable of.  The were breaking the law in his front yard, and destroying his property.  What possible logic can you have for defending them?"
5265,I hope you don't have that kind of attitude toward victims of other crimes.
5266,No lethal action took place. I will admit he could have stayed in his doorway or few steps out with the rifle raised. Though the video did not show the who he was pointing at and what was occurring. Reporter says they 'ran away in terror' but they are recording standing there. Everything the 'victims' say is contradicted with video or not shown.

5269,Honestly I'll take a large lake over the beach any day. And I've lived in California my whole life.

Yup, that's why you shouldn't get drunk and destroy private property. There are people make this look like a pacifist out there. "

5278,"So if someone slaps you, it's okay to shoot them?

There are responses that are considered appropriate.  Pulling an illegal firearm on petty vandals isn't appropriate.

Sure, things worked out just fine this time, but that doesn't mean if everyone begins to respond like he did that will continue being the case.

If we are to accept this response as reasonable and totally fine many others will start to follow suit. Whether it's because they think it's the right way to do it, or it's cooler to point a gun at someone and this gives them an excuse, this type of behavior can only make things worse (again, imo)."

You can disagree if you want, but to think this is going to be looked upon in a positive light by those you need to convince guns are okay is seriously dumb.

I'm pointing out the issues with this guys actions as someone who has no issue with guns themselves. Those who are anti-gun are going to find this to be *much* worse than I do. If you really want to help support pro-gun policy, you cannot ignore the flaws in this mans actions.

Someone probably forwarded the image to him and he ran with it, being from a generation that didn't put hyperconsume media (and not part of a political profession that forced him to learn) probably means he wouldn't know the nuances to a sheriff star vs a generic six-point.

5414,"I don't think the image was consciously tweeted to get anti-semite votes for Trump. However, it was spectacularly dumb to tweet it in the first place (without seeing the possible backlash) and then just mind-bogglingly dumb to double down after the backlash. He has nothing to gain here.

His statement only addresses the six-pointed star (which, to be fair is not strictly a star of david). However, there is more to the antisemitism accusation than just the fact that the image contained a six-pointed star. If the image had just been of Hillary and the six-pointed star said that she wipes her butt back-to-front the issue wouldn't have been nearly so great. The problem was majorly amplified by the presence of the money in the image and the fact that the accusation was about greed--opening (mostly reasonable) ideas about jewish stereotypes.

I think the issue of the Trump campaign isn't just that they are trying to dog-whistle antisemites (did they really think no one would notice the issue with the image in the hyper-sensitive modern age) into thinking Hillary is Jewish, just that the media term and Trump himself will throw out anything that vaguely fits their agenda without much research into the source or implications--allegedly this source originated with some neo-Nazi elements or something. This hypothesis fits with previous incidents of retweeting white supremacists, etc.

Donald's tweet wouldn't have been a story if it didn't originate from a white supremacist who probably did legitimately put in that shape as an anti-Semitic nod, even if those of us who don't go around thinking about racism and racists all the time would have just as easily seen a sheriff star in that shape (I mean it's not a hexagram but a filled in star, so it's just as different).

5593,That should be a much more important detail then it is being treated
5594,"She doesn't have the time, too busy ~~taking bribes~~ campaigning. "
5595,We are basically saying corruption is OK if she wins
5596,"its simple its all about experience, which bernie simply doesn't have."
5597,Why would Trump be any worse then her?
5598,"""Vote for me because I'm not Trump"" is an incredibly shitty, uninspiring, low-effort campaign slogan."
5599,This was posted yesterday too. 
5600,No one is watching a fucking hour long video. 
5601,Hillary is pure concentrated evil.
5602,Literally anyone would be better than Hillary. 
5603,Nate silver gave Trump a 5% chance of winning the Nomination but hey if you want to act like he is accurate be my guests.
5604,"me either, my mind is made up.  I don't care what people say, she's the best choice!  and she's about to make history as the first woman prez!"
5605,Do you think she is with you?
5606,I guess you wouldn't be a Trump supporter if you didn't oversimplify complex issues.
5607,"Yes, i honestly believe we will never come back from the damage she will do."
5608,Nope. No charges mean no corruption. I'm sorry if that hurts your feels...
5609,"Oh, all the people who commented happen to be one of the 275 people in the world who watched this video between now and yesterday. I retract my statement. "
5610,Hey that's giving evil a bad name!
5611,"Say it a million times until it sticks, right?"
5612,So this is what life would be like if I valued feelings over facts and had a problem with women in authority 
5613,There were almost a dozen more variables in the Republican primary than there are in the general. The statistical models are significantly simpler to predict for generals which is why he has been so incredibly accurate in generals. 
5614,"That aside, how many of trumps wins did he get wrong?"
5615,"You are left with RCP, Sam Wang, and HuffPost Model.

"
5616,"she's a woman and i'm a woman, but you probably wouldn't understand"
5617,She is under criminal investigation by the FBI for committing multiple felonies. I don't know what complex detail of yours might negate that fact.
5618,I'm voting Trump in November. It is the first time I will be voting Republican.
5619,What will you say when she is indicted? I hope that doesn't hurt your feels too bad.
5620,It has already struck.
5621,You know you've lost when you bring up sexism out of nowhere. 
5622,You trying to say i dont like women with authority?
5623,I have no clue. I don't follow Nate Silver
5624,And they all say Trump has a 20-25% chance of winning. Yeah Ok
5625,I don't understand to be honest. So you are voting for her just because she is a woman? If Sarah Palin was the R nominee and Bernie was the D nominee would you vote Palin.
5626,"Under investigation (with a likely no-charge upcoming) does not make her a criminal. Trump is also under investigation and the defendant in many lawsuits - if we assume guilt before anything, that'd make him just as criminal as she."
5627,Yeah im voting trump also. Almost everyone i meet is. Ive only met one person voting hillary.
5628,I'm voting Trump as well. 
5629,Suuuuuure....
5630,We shall see.
5631,"Afraid that most Americans wouldn't call her pure, concentrated evil. "
5632,I can not believe her Supporters are so dumb that they would think that is a winning strategy. 
5633,No that's absolutely not what I'm implying at all. I have no idea how you came to such an absurd conclusion.
5634,So then why write him off ?
5635,"Nate Silver said the exact same thing but he is not good enough for you?

That is weird."
5636,knew you wouldn't understand
5637,"1) A lawsuit is very different then a Criminal Investigation by the FBI. Anyone can bring a lawsuit against anyone.
2) If you are running for President you should be above reproach. The FBI should not feel the need to conduct a major investigation into you while you are the Democratic Nominee.
3) No one knows except the FBI agents working on the case how likely or unlikely It will be that Hillary is indicted. The fact that Lynch said she would except the recommendations from the FBI wether to indict or not makes it much more likely. "
5638,[deleted]
5639,I know no one I know supports her and I'm hearing that from more and more people. I know a ton of Trump Supporters though and a some Bernie Supporters. I live in a Blue City (Pittsburgh) and I am 32 so there should be some.
5640,"Hey, don't underestimate hillary's support.  They're quiet.  Same thing happened in the primaries, somehow you'd never meet a Hillary supporter in real life, but they came out in droves."
5641,I think Hillary and her Supporters (If she is not in Federal Custody by then) are in for a rough Day in November.
5642,Why do you think I'm lying? A lot of people in the Rust belt are doing the same this election.
5643,Yeah it is in the hands of the FBI now. No one else knows what will happen.
5644,They call her evil. But is that what it takes for something to Stick? Does it take the majority of Americans.
5645,Would you Vote for Sarah Palin to be President or do you have a problem with Women with authority.
5646,I don't believe Nate Silver
5647,So would you vote for Sarah?
5648,"The fact that you are a nominee should have absolutely no bearing on whether or not you go under investigation. We'll see what happens, but if the FBI does indeed conclude that there was no criminal wrongdoing, I hope that this is finally put to rest and people don't resort to conspiracy theories that the FBI was bought off, etc"
5649,Lol okay 
5650,Must have a very small social circle.
5651,Don't you think that is very odd? Because I knew a fair number of Cruz Supporters and even some Rubio (I used to be one) and Carson Supporters. It is just very strange to me. I don't see her signs or bumper stickers either.
5652,What will YOU say if she is not indicted? Will that be enough to let it go?
5653,You got that backwords. If you are under FBI investigation it should have a ton of bearing on if she is the nominee or not. I don't know how people will react if she is found guilty. Bill certainly added fuel to the conspiracy fire with his secret meeting with Lynch though.
5654,I knew a lot people who supported her in 2008 know none of them do. I don't see her signs or her bumper stickers either.
5655,"I don't think its odd at all.  I think they're uninformed, so they can't really add much to any conversation.  So think about all the people you know that aren't informed, aren't political, those are your hillary supporters.  I'm sure they think they're playing it safe, and that the DNC is the safe bet."
5656,It is tough one. I would let this particular issue go because I know the FBI is not politically motivated. So I would say She is innocent on this one. I do however will still think she is dishonest just because there have been too many times her ethics have been called into question. What about you?
5657,Who are her 2008 supporters going for? Trump?
5658,Maybe you are correct. Her Supporters could just be that 40% or whatever that doesn't contribute that Mitt talked about. Judgement from her Facebook Followers that may be the case.
5659,"If she is indicted then follow the path where it may lead. That's the law. That said, I feel that many people don't like Hillary but have a hard time coming up with much substance to back it up. I am serious and not saying anything to you to be rude. I actually just had the thought: ""damn, I'm having a good civil conversation on reddit politics!""
What are some of the reasons you dislike Hillary? I truly want to try to understand."
5660,Believe it or not yes or they aren't voting. I think being a Democrat in the Rust Belt is different then being a Democrat in the rest of the country. We aren't really very Liberal in general.
5661,"Or maybe, just maybe, anecdotal evidence is stupid.

I know many, many lifelong Republicans who can't bring themselves to vote for Trump, no matter how much they hate Hillary. I can count on one hand the people I know who have gone on record saying they are going to vote Trump. It doesn't mean there aren't millions of Trumpeteers out there, because of course they are. It means that you, I, and lots of other people tend to have insular social circles where we don't often interact with people who have vastly different beliefs.

Also, trying to avoid shitposting on social media on behalf of their preferred candidate doesn't mean they're uninformed. It could also mean they don't spend a lot of time on social media. Shocking, right?"
5662,"Well my Mother loved the Clintons and I grew up thinking Bill was this great President. I was excited to vote for her in 2008 before she lost the nomination. 

What changed was in 2010 I started working at a company that does a lot of work for the coal mines. I also moved to an area where coal is extremely important. During the 2012 election Obama assured us again and again that he was a friend of coal and would invest in clean coal. I actually voted for him in 2012. But after he was in office he lied and passed a lot of regulations that crashed the industry. Everyone is afraid to invest in coal now. This has destoyed the community and forced a lot of people I know into poverty. The worst part was the rhetoric that came from Obama which I feel demonized the industry and the people connected to it who I witnessed suffering.

Hillary is Obama's successor. So that opened me up to a lot of the criticsm to her I think. I started always assuming the worst about her.  Combined that with Bernie's frantical war on the industry it has really turned me against Democtats to be honest. 
Edit: What do you like about her?"
5663,"Some actual facts:

1) @FishBoneHead1's twitter account was the first place where the image appeared, it appeared with his water mark and every indication is that this twitter user created the image.

2) At some point the Trump campaign repurposed the image (removed the water mark) and tweeted it out under Donald's official  twitter account last weekend.

3) @FishBoneHead1 deleted his twitter account soon after his name became attached to the controversy. The tweets of his that we do have indicate he is an anti-semite and all around bigot (see: http://imgur.com/a/QesSA). 

Now being charitable Trump's team just swiped a dumb meme they saw on /pol/ or somewhere else on the internet without recognizing what it was. All they had to do to make the story go away was apologize and delete the tweet, instead they just editted the image a little more and oudly deny they did anything wrong. "

5716,Well that's not a good argument either. 
5717,Why are you anti vax?  It seems like a pretty ridiculous position to me.
5718,"But they do cause AIDS. That's been proven,,right?"
5719,"It isn't related to the science of vaccination itself. We know it works, anti venom wouldn't exist if it didn't. Mistrust of distributors and disagreement with the preservatives used are big factors for most people. Me personally, it is due to no respect for distributors.

For example, this was a legitimate mistake where live avian bird flu was mislabled as a vaccine due to an incompetent lab mistake. Baxter did this too, not a small player.

http://www.ctvnews.ca/baxter-admits-flu-product-contained-live-bird-flu-virus-1.374503

Gaffes like that are inexcusable and they happen more often than they should, though granted it is usually on a smaller scale. I don't give two shits about herd immunity honestly so that argument doesn't sway me. People just get fake papers when vaccines are mandatory anyway. People do it all the time. Kids need papers? Fake ones are easy to get for them too. Anti vax is here to stay. 

I don't encourage anybody not to get them if they want them but it isn't for me. The only part I object to is taking them myself or making them mandatory for anyone else that doesn't want them."

5725,I won't have to worry about that in my lifetime anyway. Too many other people are vaxxing for that to be an issue. I do benefit from other people even though I don't participate. So does everyone else who doesn't vax
5726,"> Why? I benefit from herd immunity anyway whether I give a fuck or not.

Only until vaccination rates dip below a critical threshold, which is already happening in isolated communities. Hell, you're not even pulling some Randian self interest thing here, because if you were you wouldn't be encouraging others to do the same (because their vaccinations benefit you). You're literally hurting yourself to show off how selfish you are, which is some impressive dedication to assholery."
5727,[removed]
5728,"If your child dies of a preventable disease and you created false papers to lie about your child having the vaccines that could have prevented your child from dying, that is just another charge to be given.
If your kid kills another kid that has a compromised immune system, you should also be charged with 2nd degree manslaughter."
5729,I don't encourage or discourage anyone. Do whatever you want. If you want to go for it. If you don't want it then don't get it. Basic freedom of choice perspective is my position on it.
5730,"I am a Trump supporter, of course I am a troll. We all are.

In all seriousness though, that is a perfectly good point. I already said the herd immunity argument wouldn't sway me because I don't care about it.  I benefit from it anyway even if I don't vax so how is that a good argument to persuade me to start?"

5760,"Because... ah, no. Amazing how liberals LOVE government so much that they want you controlled as a citizen like you are controlled when you pay to enter their ivory tower institutions like Princeton. Pathetic tenured profs."
5761,So people who have a negative view of her are supposed to magically become Hillbullies because of Obama? How will Obama make Hillary look less like a pile of garbage?
5762,"Naturally there will be some that say ""well I like Obama, so if he supports her, I guess I should go ahead and do it as well""

Unfortunately Obama is tarnishing his legacy by even being seen with her, but he is playing the role of party leader, trying to hand off to his next in line party leader.

If indictment is released watch how fast his support vanishes. You would see no more kind words from Obama."
5763,He has some febreeze and a couple flowers.
5764,"Obama did a wonderful job helping keep England in the EU, I'm sure this will work out well. /s"
5765,He doesn't seem bothered at all by the sense of impropriety. That taints him in my view.
5766,I think that's very true. It was viewed as interfering in their national politics.
5767,This is fucking ridiculous
5768,He should really keep feeding this story. It lets the world know how ridiculously unfit this man is for office.
5769,"exactly. anyone who would dare use a 6-pointed star has no business being anywhere near the oval office. This makes all the other allegations against him, such as child rape, seem like parking tickets by comparison"

5771,"This story is now about mind boggling incompetence. There was a simple way to make the story about Trump re-tweeting White Supremacist propaganda go away.

Trump did the opposite, because he is stupid, and his team is stupid."
5772,"Why, does it trigger you? Or do you just want to know what it's like to have friends from diverse religious backgrounds? "

5778,It's considered a legal document though. 
5779,That guy is an idiot... and if you believe him... well I'll let that hang in the air
5780,"No it is not. It is considered a founding philosophy , but has no ""force of law"". Hence the specious nature of the initial point. 

One might make the same leap and state that the words "" Under God"" means that Religious rules are also part of our laws.

A pittance of research prevents a cascade of misinformation."
5781,"Cotting v. Godard, 183 U.S. 79 (1901), the Court stated:

The first official action of this nation declared the foundation of government in these words: ""We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ""While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty, and while in all cases reference must be had to the organic law of the nation for such limits, yet the latter is but the body and the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit, and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. No duty rests more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality of rights which is the foundation of free government."""
5782,"Ergo not law, but the philosophical underpinnings of the law. QED"
5783,Sure. Same could be said of the manga carta. 
5784,"Of course the President shouldn't be able to decide who rides with him on Air Force one!

Those decisions should be left up to people like Trump."
5785,trump doesn't pay taxes.  he can stfu until he does.
5786,"Wahhh I haven't got even one decent Republican surrogate because they are either total ass clowns or hate me wahhhh! Trump better prepare for a Clinton surrogate barrage repping a very deep bench starting with Obama, Biden, Warren, Bernie, Bill, and even the current first lady. Trump will be rolling out Ben Carson and Christie. It will get ugly by the end of this month. Clinton's lineup is like Golden States while Trump's is like the Nets. "
5787,I for one am glad the President is using my tax money to defend thus this nation from Trump.
5788,Jeffery Epstein is a sure bet to ride around in air force one either way the election goes.

5790,"As far as I'm concerned if the President, and I mean any President from any party ever, wants to campaign on behalf of their party's candidate that's their choice but the bill for a $200000 an hour plane ride should be fully on the plate of that candidate's campaign.  Campaigns have warchests to pay for travel expenses etc. Do you want the considerable advantage of using the President? Fine. PAY FOR IT.   As it is they merely pay the cost of any other chartered flight and the taxpayers foot the rest of that bill.  Not right."
5791,[deleted]
5792,He's right. 
5793,The cost is split between the DNC and Hillary's campaign.
5794,Keep whining about it then. Sounds productive.
5795,"Gee, if only the Clinton campaign paid for it.  Great idea."
5796,"That's an amusing sentiment. Bully pulpit?  It's all campaigning, politics. 

Better get used to it. For his legacy and, from his perspective, for the country, until November it's president of he United States, commander in chief of getting out the vote for Clinton. 

It's pretty unfair for trump. But we haven't had this situation in a very long time and the flood gates will open. 

If you are annoyed now - wait til you see Obama break into prime time when trump does gaffes in September and October. "
5797,[deleted]
5798,"> The cost is split between the DNC and Hillary's campaign.

Except that it's not.  From CNN:

>[The cost of flying Air Force One for political travel is divided between the federal government (using taxpayer dollars) and the candidate's political organization.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/04/politics/obama-clinton-air-force-one-trump/index.html)

But feel free to tell me again how Clinton and the DNC are footing the whole bill while you provide no sources.  They pay the cost of chartering a similarly sized jet.  The rest falls to the taxpayer."
5799,Keep getting upset when someone has a valid counterpoint to your thinly veiled anti-Trump rhetoric.  Sounds productive.  This isn't about Trump deciding who can fly on Air Force One it's about taxpayers paying the bills for ANY candidates luxuries.
5800,Trump is lucky he's the nominee now and not 4 years ago. Obama would have beat him like a red headed step child. 
5801,"You posted a link that shows that the president should reimburse the people for the expense 

So yeah, Trump is right.

Aside from the impropriety of it - this walks and talks like a rigged election. "
5802,"Does OP's article count as a source?

>As in other Administrations, we follow all rules and regulations to ensure that the DNC or other relevant political committee pays what is required for the President to travel to political events"
5803,Some people do get their panties all knotted up over such things. It's sad.
5804,It's not a valid counterpoint.  It's low energy whining.
5805,[removed]
5806,[deleted]
5807,"Yes it does count.  Let's see what the part that proves my claim is:

>pays what is required 

What is required is the cost of chartering a similarly sized jet. The rest falls to the taxpayer."
5808,Muddy the water. You done good. Have a biscuit. 
5809,Maybe they can use some of that Benghazi money. 
5810,I'll be waiting with baited breath for my check 
5811,"So basically, nobody broke any laws or committed FEC violations. 

I don't care."
5812,"There's no muddying needed. Presidents have campaigned for nominees for a long time now. There are rules to make the DNC and the nominee pay for costs. 

It's only a big deal to Trump supporters because 14 year olds don't understand math or history. "
5813,"> I don't care.

Which is fine.  If you don't care money you pay in taxes that's meant to make the country function, for YOU the taxpayer, on a daily basis is being used to fly candidates around to campaign stops that's your right."
5814,lol
5815,Not a single person is coated in that article. Everyone is wearing summer button ups. 
5816,"There is no evidence to support such a hateful claim. Were there no AP reporting of Democratic activities, I find it difficult to believe any other news organisation or syndicate could fail to provide evidence of this apparent hatred that has been reported"
5817,"They supported slavery, and we'll never forget that."
5818,"> They supported slavery

Well, the party of angry white guys in the deep south did that.

Now remind me, which party does that describe these days?"
5819,"Google ""southern strategy.""

The Democrats from 1816 are not the same Democrats from 1916. Neither are anything like the 2016 version."
5820,"A father singing ""Happy Birthday"" to his daughter is a nice moment, but not really political.  I'd rather not see it here just because I'd rather not see the horrible shit some people will say in response to it."
5821,I remember his singing voice being better than that. Beautiful moment nonetheless. And Malia is gorgeous as well.
