313,"> The idea that Don Jr. didn’t know the identity of the person he was meeting with preserved the possibility that he walked into the meeting totally blind. All he knew was that he was meeting with a friend of a friend — the meeting had been brokered by someone Don Jr. met in Russia during a Miss Universe pageant — who had information about Clinton.

and? Even if jr lied, you don't think Clinton met with several people to try and give her and her campaign dirt on Trump? The entire media was on her side.

>But, according to the Times, Don Jr. received an email from the same person who set up the meeting making clear that the material was part of a Russian government effort to help his father’s candidacy.

Again, who gives a damn this is all semantics. It isn't illegal either. Did we ever see Don jr. post relevant damning info about Clinton? I was here throughout the entire time and we were begging for dirt on Clinton, most came from wikileaks and most were of course ignored by the MSM.

>So, even if he didn’t know the exact name or identity of the Russian lawyer he was to meet with, he knew — if he read his email — that whatever he was told in the meeting was part of a foreign government’s efforts to help choose its preferred candidate in the 2016 election.

Why would't he at least listen? Especially with how his father was mercilessly attacked every hour by the main stream media. 

>Sit with that for a minute: The eldest son of the de facto Republican presidential nominee reportedly met with someone he knew was peddling information as part of a Russian government effort to elect his dad.

And what effort was that exactly? Could this author at least provide evidence to suggest this to be the case? oh right there still isn't any substantial evidence pointing to exactly what Russia did effectively to cause Trump to be elected. Also lets not pretend that the American government hasn't meddled in the elections of other countries.

He's actually pretty centre. He's not that right-wing. He just seems to be because the world has been fucked so hard to the left over the past decade or two. His healthcare reform was very left wing. He's still big government in a lot of areas. 

But what he's done to the corrupt media is so important. Probably the most important thing for America in this decade. He's given people the freedom to speak out again without being slandered as a homophobe/racist/bigot/sexist by everyone on the left. That alone brings America to closer to it's original values and literally makes it ""great again"". This is what won him the election, half of the nation was calling the other half deplorable nazis, I wonder who they all voted for as a result of that. Kek.

There's still a long way to go, but I dread to think what would happen if he wasn't in office right now. Even if he makes mistakes the good is going to outweigh the bad. There's still an incredibly large about of far-left people who are diseased with that immoral ideology that have become brainwashed beyond reason.

""You censor news that doesnt favor him.""

We dont censor. We just dont report. News against President Trump is everywhere and we use this sub-reddit to highlight the pro-ones. With the cesspool of negative news, dont you want a go-to-guide of positive news of about the person you follow.

""You always agree on his policies.""

I'd like to trigger the ""Paradox of Unanimity"". When 100% of a community agress on something, it is more likely that this something is not trustworthy. 

Unlike what you accused us, we dont exhibit the paradox of unanimity. I for one have expressed differing opinions resulting in amazing discussions (some I win, some I concede). But all in all, we are free to express our thougts here. 

Case in point, the Syria attack. This subreddit is divided. Some agree that the bomb attack on Syrian base after the Syrian gas was justified to a point it makes Trump very presidential. Others disagree. Simply, a lot of Trump voters want to drain the swamp and try to avoid ""war-mongering"". 

We had a healthy civil discussions about that topic and most other topics. The divisive discussions usually end with us trusting the God Emperor's decision. 

All in all, this subreddit believed that, ""We voted for someone to lead, not someone we can always agree on""

Sorry, the ""censoring"" ones are not us.

Do your due-diligence ...Play devil's advocate.... take apart some of that scientific research and data down to the original data points.... challenge it and reassemble it to see if it actually holds up to valid scrutiny and be honest with yourself

By their numbers alone, they are blocking the shithole Democrats from impeaching Trump, which allows him to stay in office and keep fighting for OUR RIGHTS, which considering what he is up against, I think he is doing a hell of a job.

Trump is a fucking brawler. They just can't beat him down. I am so fucking impressed with how tough he is. He isn't take shit off of the Democrats who have it out for him and are playing dirty.

They should all be prosecuted together for all the crimes under RICO. This would send everyone the correct message and do more to restore credibility in the USA. However, this may not be possible. Which is why I raise the idea of marshal, or is it spelled martial law... See that marshal law situation may be the only way Trump can remove them all safely.

I looked into the % of JEWS in the MSM in the USA and was shocked and horrified. That is why you see me speaking up here on Reddit a lot more lately. Those people in that industry are the greatest deceivers. And yes, Jews make the best spin doctors fortunately or unfortunately depending on how that is used. CNN employees the worst of our people, but I can only be responsible for myself. I can accept a modicum of responsibility to the point where I will be all to happy to call out such deceptive news people. I do not care that Jews dominate that business, we are amongst the smartest and hardest working of peoples and some of the best show people. What I mind is deception and fake news to convince hundreds of millions of non Jews of blatant lies. The Jewish people must not be complicit in this crime by remaining silent. So I am not silent. I will be able to answer to God with a clear conscience."
1198,I don't hold the Jewish people responsible for these snakes.  Their seditious cunts.  They have to answer for their lies.  Like you I will not be muted.  I refuse to leave this country fucked up for our children.  That's part of the reason I voted for the President.  This country got fucked up in just 8 years. Time to fix it.

1894,"Here's a legitimate reason: Service men and women are 50% likely than their civilian counterparts to attempt suicide, particularly if they have been deployed. Add on top of that fact that transgenders account for .6% of the population (according to ucla.edu) and they are 46% more likely to commit suicide than someone who isn't trans, and that's not even for enlisted trans people, that's just people who are sitting on their asses in the states. Then you have the gall to say that we should endanger our patriots serving our country by having mentally unstable components in their fire teams? The thing about the military is NO ONE HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SERVE IN IT. The military is for the defense of our country, not to virtue signal. If transgenders really want to serve our country then they should be willing to postpone their operations and therapy and whatever until after they are done serving. 

It isn't the military's responsibility to ensure that everyone is getting the medical treatment they think they are entitled to. "
1895,"males and females in the military are not set to the same physical training standards, and if they changed that they would either have to kick 99% of the females out or set the standards for males too low for them to accomplish their missions, no one wants to be tempted to change genders or lose their job cuz they can't cut it. horny young men going months if not years without so much as seeing a woman is too much motivation for those men to want to shower/live with the females. females are much more likely to stay at the FOB when deployed (as in they get out of a lot of dangerous stuff) and we don't want people to feel tempted to cut off their dick or die from an IED, and many more reasons."

1904,"First off, you're two days late. Second, it was a white minority, and third, the RF believed in institutionalizing racial divides and the right to provide separate amenities to separate races. Not really a group or individual worthy of praise."
1905,Keep this crap off here- you don't belong.
1906,Fuck you snowflake.
1907,The whites were the able majority though. The majority of people capable of governing and understanding civil governance in Rhodesia proper were white making it a white majority. The people in the Bantustans had their own governance and thus were not part of Rhodesia proper. Rhodesia and the white majority government were the administrators of the country and very able administrators at that. Races weren't physically kept apart but different services were provided for the different needs of the races. Whites didn't necessarily need agricultural equipment and aid in rural areas like black farmers did so why provide it to them? Whites mostly lived in urban environments and required different kinds of amenities.
1908,"If you support Communism in Zimbabwe right now then you don't belong. Ian Smith was a hero and did good for the whole of Africa. The whole mess that Zimbabwe and South Africa are in right now is due to the Soviet Union funding rebels ""freedom fighters"" to overthrow the white governments when really everybody liked the white governments an accepted them. Africans didn't want to vote and didn't need to. They could vote for their own leaders inside of their respective Bantustans and do all of their political activities through that medium. White rule was not only prosperous for everybody but it was necessary. The prosperity of Rhodesia, South Africa, Botswana, Angola, Namibia and other countries under white majority rule were much more prosperous than they are now. They are a mess now and its because their Communist governments under the criminal dictators Robert Mugabe and Nelson Mandela and so on ruined the economies."
1909,"Come on, you can do better than that. Are you paid by the word or the post?"
1910,"The Africans were technically part of Rhodesia, they were part of the demography of Rhodesia, so they were the majority, not the whites. And if you're referring to the Native Reserves, those were all overseen by all-white council's, so the African populations did not possess their own governments, they were at the will of a belligerent minority. "

1916,I reject abortion completely. It is absolute evil
1917,"I am personally against it, but will not deprive others from their ability to have one.  Do not expect to use my tax dollars to pay for it.  "
1918,"I'm not religious either, but I am opposed to it on the grounds that scientifically, from the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg, that zygote is a distinct human with it's own set of DNA. I don't think the government should base a person's right to live on their stage of development, because it opens up a whole can of worms. At what point do we decide ok, now.its NOT ok? Because the baby can't survive without it's mother really at any point, even after birth.

However I support it for rape etc."
1919,"not morally opposed to it early, don't want to pay for it unless I got the P"
1920,[deleted]
1921,"shouldn't make laws against things you can't stop.  women will always be able to kill an unborn baby, better to make it quick and clean instead of having girls throwing themselves down steps.


we should either find out at what point a fetus gets its first brain activity and draw a line then, or set the limit at 20 weeks (right at the point where a fetus can be considered likely to survive out of the womb).  obviously there should be exceptions in case where the mothers life is at stake.


that being said, there should be zero federal funds in the abortion industry, and employers should not have to provide coverage if they object on moral grounds."
1922,[deleted]
1923,I would never tell another human being whose life I'm not living what to do in case of unwanted pregnancy so I'm pro choice. (I have no children and never wanted any because the responsibility is too much)
1924,"I don't take a stance on abortion, it's too slippery."
1925,"My take as a physician is that third trimester abortion should be illegal.  If the fetus can be viable outside of the mother then killing it should be the same as killing a child.  Prior to that point though the fetus cannot survive without the mother so forcing her to carry it and any risks associated with it is not my place.

I'd be okay with planned parenthood if they didn't have  quotas on abortions and didn't sell baby parts.  "

1946,we never like transgender

But because of ""bundleing"" (a marketing scheme) the T is added and we become ""unfriendly"". I think this is a source issue which needs to be sorted out, we are just consumers, marketing is a ""source"" issue. "
1948,"There are a lot of different people on this sub with a lot of different opinions. This sub is also an echo-chamber for supporting the president (not a bad thing, that's its purpose). Therefore, the president gets praise from some of us when he does x and the others of us remain quiet, when the president later does y then those of us who were quiet before begin to sing his praise. You dig? We aren't a monolithic group, we are ""diverse"", but we only post when we support the president."

1971,Wrong.
1972,"Bannon actually is a leaker but one of a different type. He isn't one trying to undermine the president but is a leaker of opportunity trying to position himself as some sort of shadowy Mastermind behind the Trump presidency for the sake of his own brand. Where is he is going to stick around for tax reform because there are some things there that he wants to accomplish but afterwards will likely leave because he sees the writing on the wall. That doesn't necessarily mean they want to get rid of abandon but he does feel he doesn't really fit in there and would like to get back to being an external advocate rather than a part of the DC culture.

When he leaves it will be on good terms. But that doesn't change the fact that ban and was one of the chief Lakers to guys like cernovich and Posobiec. He has since chilled on that"

1998,so this law that no one has ever heard of and no one has ever been punished for exists...seems like we should just get rid of it

... 

> To date, no one has ever been convicted or indicted for violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and most of the dozen or so violations reported each year result in little more than administrative penalties. **Still, a ""knowing and willful violation"" of the Anti-Deficiency Act is a Class E felony, punishable by a ""$5,000 fine, confinement for up to two years, or both.**""

He is pragmatic enough to admit that his own views on topics are not important, that his only 2 bosses are his mom and Donald J. Trump, and that his goal is to push out the Presidents message.

Trump understands basic human psychology, in that people are attracted to alphas, whether they are willing to admit so or not. Trump is a nurturing alpha, a rare form of the personality, in which he has a subconscious desire to protect those under his watch. 

Mooch is a straight up rabid alpha. He's essentially an extension of Trump, and will allow Trump to focus on other important things."

If you have a president who publicly claims he wants to destroy the coal industry, stop oil drilling, and wants to take over national healthcare then the economy will tank. If you have a president who says he is going to bring back jobs and promotes energy independence while also lowering taxes then yeah, people are going to be excited and the economy will improve.

Now, as President, he is doing the opposite and taking credit for it. He shouldn't be doing this. Watch, in a year or so my point will be proven. The market and economy will be doing terrible and the media will absolutely use his words against him. He needs to switch blame for the terrible economy BEFORE he was president and start blaming democrats for that. If you look at the cyclicality of the economy we get big booms during Democrat years (because they spend so much god damn money), and when a republican takes office the central bank raises interest rates to suppress growth. The contraction in credit slows the economy and eventually causes the excess spending of credit to collapse. He needs to be careful."

I'm not sure how presidential representation somehow equates to if a religion deserves cult status or not but apparently my brain doesn't process logic in the same way yours does. As for T_D isolating people, T_D has been isolated from Reddit since almost day 1. It is your side that is doing everything they can to censor us because you are afraid of what we have to say. You don't go to that much effort if you don't acknowledge how effective their arguements are. You were allowed to post here until you displayed you could not behave as is expected of an adult. We get banned from places we have never posted. Big difference.

You were banned because you brought nothing to the table. If you had made any type of actual arguement, people would have engaged. You basically came here and chucked a kiddy tantrum. It was unsightly, especially when you were trying to claim people that post here lack reason, logic and character.

Slightly edit what you posted here and post it in a pro-Hillary, Bernie, leftie thread attacking them the same way and see the result, it will be the same. You getting removed because you are ill-equipped to socially interact with people like an adult proves no point you were trying to make.

OP's reply was: ""If they are able to whenever and how ever they can.""

Here's my response in case they check back:

The military's purpose is to be an effective fighting force. Any effort spent on something else, like accommodating specific personnel must result in a net positive result for fighting efficiency. Things that are easy like MOS restrictions for the colorblind are fine. Re-purposing entire methodologies from training to operations to allow blind service members is not. Trans people require extra medical resources and time away from their jobs, for no extra benefit.

When you want results in the real world you can't waste time and resources making sure everyone's feelings aren't hurt."
2331,I thought liberals don't want mentally ill people to have access to guns?
2332,Please tell me how long you served 
2333,"So you're okay with lowering the standards to make everyone ""equal""? It's okay that they can't lift a 250 lb soldier who is bleeding out? Whatever right? So long as it makes us feel good in the end!"
2334,Mental illness.
2335,No one can hear you over that huge dick in your mouth shill
2336,The military isn't a therapy session or a social experiment. It is a killing machine. Leave it to the military to decide how to best keep it the most effective fighting force in human history.
2337,"If you have a mini break down over being called ""Sir"" on the phone. 

I don't think you have the mental fortitude to deal with bullets and bombs. They do a bit more damage and pose a bit more of a threat than ""Misgendering"" or mean tweets."
2338,"With a 41% suicide rate, I'd say that transgender people aren't psychologically fit for military duty.  As a tax payer I also don't want to pay for hormone replacement therapy or genital mutilation."
2339,"If you are taking hormones and other medications daily I can see why you would not be allowed. For example, you cant take adderall if you have adhd in the military. There are reasons for this and this ban follows the same logic"
2340,My wife got kicked out of the military when she was diagnosed with diabetes.  She found another way to serve.  What level of accommodations do you think should be afforded to people in a warfighting outfit?
2341,"A bit of advice: asking a question and then calling those who might disagree with your opinion ""primitive"" is not a great way to open a discussion.

But I digress. The reason we should not have transgender people in the military is very simple: the military's role is to defend the nation and destroy our enemies. Anything that distracts from that mission is a hindrance. Having biological males showering in female locker rooms and having to take time and therapy to ""transition"" is a distraction. The military is not the place to conduct a social experiment.

I also object on fiscal grounds. Why should taxpayer dollars fund sex change operations? There is no conceivable national security interest that is furthered by paying for sex changes."
2342,They can join the military AFTER their full transition. It's to save the tax money used for the trans process. That's it. Not really that big of a deal. 
2343,"If you enlist, then you'll understand."
2344,People with mental problems should not have access to weapons
2345,"[Here's one reason.](https://i.redd.it/1mqu7zodazbz.jpg)

Now look at the costs. The military is supposed to kill people and break things. Transgenders, going through medical operations, are sidelined and ineffective. And then there's the aftercare. You can't readily supply all those pills and hormones in a combat zone.

Now look at squad readiness. Some people may not have a problem serving with transgenders. Some might. If a transgender person is worried about the doctor and caring for their operation, that person might not be able to serve at full readiness. Swap out that person? Ok, but then there's a new person in a group that doesn't know the dynamics.

On the battlefield? Good luck for a transgender person if they're caught by some shitheads like ISIS. They throw gay people off roofs. I think they'd do a lot worse to a MTF or FTM soldier."

Not to mention the fact that after shooting her, the MNPD sought and executed a search warrant of Damond's home.

Do you believe the military should cover gender reassignment surgery for male to female enlistees and allow them to take leave for the months to years of surgical recovery? Should these members of the armed forces be guaranteed 4 hours a day to actively dilate their neovaginas for the remainder of their service? Do you believe a population with a greater than 40% suicide attempt rate should be granted access to military grade weapons? If you believe that disbarring transgender people from serving in the military is bigoted, what about disbarring of handicapped people (diabetes, ADHD, amputees, etc.)? Is that ableist? What about disbarring of groups with mental illnesses with a much lower suicide attempt rate than transgender people? Is that prejudice against the neuroatypical? What about overweight people? Fatphobic?

Hormone therapy can affect the mood and well being of a person, and increased risk of thromboembolic disease, myocardial infarction, breast cancer, fertility problems, stroke, abnormal liver function, renal disease, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis all can happen when under it. Male->Female transition costs around $20,000, while female->male can exceed $50,000. The military DOES fund this, as your previous comment suggested that it may not.

Good Job.

I was not intentionally overstating. Merely suggesting that since these parades were the other side, perhaps OUR PRESIDENT should reassure them that there is room in his vision of America for ALL AMERICANS. 

I think this is what is driving these kinds of protests. People (groups) are afraid they will lose their voice.
That's why there is such a diverse gathering of messages.

I'm not saying to surrender, but to simply dismiss rallies of this magnitude (500K in DC, 125K in Boston, etc...) would be missing an opportunity to possibly plant the seeds of red pilling a % of them. 

It's not gonna work if the right has to drag the left over the finish line. It has to eventually reach a point where both sides are working toward a similar vision. 

When (if) that happens, the America will become truly UNSTOPPABLE. 

I pray that Donald John Trump is the POTUS that can pull us together, because there is big, BIG WORK TO DO. And it's going to take all of us to get it done.

The other 3 doctors also tell you that you have diabetes, but fuck what the other 97 doctors say, still eat donuts for breakfast everyday and take this snake oil instead. Who are you going to listen to? And what would happen if you listened to the other 3 doctors?
Global warming is not a liberal conspiracy. 97% of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing from human related activities, and the other 3% only disagree on the cause. The is no disagreement among scientists that the Earth's climate is changing unlike it ever has before.
Fossils fuels are very cheap and our society is heavily dependent on them, they are not going anywhere soon. But renewable energy needs to be invested in for the long term survival of our country. The short term benefits of lowered regulations is like borrowing money on credit that will need to eventually be paid back later. The effects of climate change are already affecting our country and it will only get worse over time.
This is something that will not greatly affect the older generation, but something that today's children and young adults and their children will be greatly effected by. We want America to be great and prosperous for ourselves and for the next generation and those that come after. If we neglect this problem while there is time to do something about it, our children and their children will be left a great burden because we were too busy turning our heads the other way.
I have no doubt We the People and our President will make this country great again, but part of that includes not denying the facts and addressing the problem of climate change.

3121,"Not to mention the fact that he has had podcasts with callers as recently as 2016 in which he claims he does not support immigration law and does not approve of the initiation of force on illegal immigrants. There is a clear, upward trend in popularity from his first Trump video to the present day...it's so painfully obvious he is just pandering to the popularity of whatever group is currently ripe for the picking.

3225,"Not cool.

You might not like Obama but wanting to have his dog killed over political differences is a total douche move."
3226,LOCK HER UP
3227,Dog is a religion of peace. We need to focus on mansplaining the fascist desire of white males to have personal space and how they think they DESEREVE to not be bitten. 
3228,No.  This isn't funny.  Looks like a great dog. 
3229,Oh fuck off
3230,"OK here is my disclaimer: I am a dog lover and owner. I work with dogs that have real long term problems like fear aggression, resource guarding, destructive/separation anxiety.  
  
Ya this is definitely not cool. Dogs are not accessories or decorative items. They are living beings with the capacity of emotion. 90% of bites occur because of human error. People fail to see the physical signs a dog displays when it is uncomfortable, stressed, feeling threatened, ect. The other main problem is people to fail to supervise their dogs, especially with young children. No matter how much we humanize our pets ""as part of the family or they are like my kids"" they are animals and have a limited scope of communication. They can not speak our language, you must lean how to understand theirs. You have to learn and respect their limitations and tolerance levels to situations and interactions. Especially without basic training and structured commands, young children should not be left unattended with any dog, no matter how much you trust them.
Multiple reports say that the bite occurred when SHE tried to hug and kiss the dog. They dog did not go after her, chase her or jump on her, unprovoked. SHE invaded the dogs personal space and put her body and face on the dog. Had she not done this action, there would have been no indecent.  
I guarantee that the dog has a handler. In this situation the dog will be bonded to that person who is the caregiver and provider. Even though the dog may have regular time spent with other people (the Obama daughters, staff or a second handler), that environment is secondary to the main caregiver relationship. Also, even for the most acclimated dog in an environment with large amounts of people, strangers, and activity, the dog will still have limitations."
3231,Look at all the CTR cucks in here trying to turn this into something else.   Upvotes for all pro killing of Obama's dog.  
3232,"What I read is this: the 18 year old wanted to ""pet and *kiss*"" the dog.   

How I interpret that:  excited girl with high pitched voice leans in and over dog, possibly holding dog by the sides of the head, cutting off escape route.  Pushes face with teeth bared (smile) close to dogs face.   Dog bites.

The fact she mentioned ""kissing"" the dog made me think she had him in the classic ""bite me"" position.  I bet the dog is fine, and the girl needs to learn some canine skills.  Also, and this is purely speculation, but this animal is in the middle of a large household upheaval, and sooommmmeee times young people are a wee bit altered.   Both or either would be contributing factors.
"
3233,"His dog bit a girl in the face. That not political differences, thats a danger to society."
3234,It bit a girl on the face. It's clearly a danger.
3235,"The dog bit a girl in the face and scarred her.

for no reason apparently.

It needs to die."
3236,TL;DR
3237,In most cases the owner needs to be euthanised. Never seen a dog growing up with an agreeable person who was a danger to anybody. 
3238,"The girl hasn't given a statement. For all we know she tried to climb the fence and the dog did what it was meant to do protect the home. They could also have been play fighting and the dog misjudged something.

You're allowed to keep dogs, even dogs that are 'dangerous' on your own grounds for reasonable reason. See literally every guard dog ever."
3239,"Well it's not going to , and thankfully no one gives a shit about you. GL with that too signatures. Oh btw legally they can't do anything to the dog if the victim doesn't want to do anything, and I'm sure she won't because she's a family friend"
3240,"Uh, no, we know everything.
The girl was a family friend that was petting the dog like every other time she was there and it suddenly bit her.
Do some research before you BS."
3241,"So the dog bit a family friend that pets the dog like every other time. Does that sound like it makes sense to you? That a dog bites a person that it is used to having around and petting it? The explanations that make sense are: startled or play-fighting or has dementia (which would be pretty uncommon for a 4 year old dog).

Also the family decided to not press charges so it isn't your decision to make. You know you're doing this because it is Obama's dog and not because someone's dog somewhere bit a family friend on someone's private property. You're not going to lie your way out of that. The title gives it away.

I have a dog that is lovely however if 10 people crowd around it and he doesn't know half of them and encroach on his space while he is loudly barking then in theory he might nibble someone which at his size would be a 'bite'. Honestly he wouldn't bite a robber normally (for better or for worse)."

3296,"> He seems to not have a focus on ""making america great again"" like he said he would. Since he has not been able to do much to make America great again, I want to know about what he actually HAS planned, and what he actually HAS done. I mean besides changing the tax brackets to ""simplify"" it, what has been a good thing he has done? The tax bracket change would result in the average person getting a negligible change in tax rate (~2 percent), but for the wealthiest millionaires yes they would gain a huge benefit to the drastic changes he is creating for the wealthy (again - since republicans are from the poorest and least productive states - why would the GOP voters possibly vote for the Billionaire that would just increase the separation of wealth? It makes little sense to me considering the GOP states are also massively dependent on welfare services. Besides his economic decisions which will appear to not benefit the the majority of americans, but instead is targeted at the wealthy - I want to hear more about his Cabinet picks.
So in regards to his choices- do people honestly think those choices are... good? That the swamp will be drained? That is what he claimed but, I want to hear one person that could possibly defend some of his choices. Such as Rick Perry? It seemed like some sort of joke really. Obama chose an actual physicist - Trump chose a person that got a degree in... animal science... and averaged D+ in those classes :( Its saddening. Is Trump aware that Rick literally could not even remember the DOE existed? During his speech that called for the literal END of the Department of energy? Why did Trump choose a person that strongly denied climate change as his head of an Energy department? The DOE deals with decisions regarding to nuclear activity. There seems to be a general consensus Rick Perry is not a smart man - and Trump saw fit to put him in charge of certain Nuclear decisions? I dont get it. Please help me

In case you want to see the concern troll's post after it is deleted."
3297,"""Since he has not been able to do much to make America great again,"" -- were you expecting him to do that before inaugaration?

Essentially you sound: a. salty as fuck about Rick Perry and b. in love with Barack 'doubled the debt for no gain' Obama.

Trump's going to introduce term limits and has fired lobbyists from his team which is more than anyone before him. 

If you really want to drain the swamp, or make a change, you can't fire every mud monster in Washington. Because you'll either: be killed or be constantly obstructed. How's about you wait four years for him to do something instead of praising Obama for eight years of nothing. "
3298,Very long did not read much. What I can say is that trump is lowering much more tax then you think. Most of the taxbreaks for the weilthy will enable them to INVEST in jobs which will make the middle class better off since they will have jobs.

3301,"Nice thank you! 

Wait - nobody is even able to stay on point. I only brought up like 2 things nobody can even give a response - let alone a well thought out explanation. 

Do you think his cabinet picks such as Rick Perry are actually good? The guy is an animal scientist that forgot the Department of Energy even existed - now hes running it. Lol you gotta admit it almost looks like a twisted ironic joke. 

Also- Considering his tax plan is clearly aimed at the rich and does almost nothing for the non millionaires - do you think his economic plans are good? Do we all agree that Trickle Down doesnt work? Or do some people think making the rich even richer some how helps the poor. I honestly dont know what people think. But, I mean,  why did people elect a billionaire to get the billionaires out of the Government. Lol why would he be rooting for the common guy, he even showed in his tax plan prior to the election - he wasnt gonna do a single thing for the working man. At least the democrats wanted to increase minimum wage ya know.

Bonus questions to anybody that can answer: How is that Mexican funded wall coming along? I better not pay a dime of my taxes towards it because Mr. Trump promised me those Mexicans would pay! Also how about that stop and frisk? Is it gonna happen? Also, is the whole banning Muslims from America for being from terrorist countries gonna happen? Also was Trump right when he said Global Warming was an idea created by the Chinese for economic benefit - is that a real thing according to The_Donald? 

Cant wait to hear some well thought out responses! MAGA!"

3303,"Well 1 - Is it typical for this many people to post but get zero answers or explanations in The donald? You.... actually support Perry as lead of DEO? lol ok then... Do people also think Obama didnt do anything? He reinstilled faith in the economy singlehandedly- Do you people have such short attention spans that you cant remember 8 years ago? I think it was like the greatest economic downturn since ya know... the recession.Obama got us out of it in 3 years LOL. You also realize he created so many jobs that unemployment hasnt been lower in years and years? And also the fact he was Commander in Chief when Osama Bin Laden was caught? Lets ignore those. No seriously were not talking about him, No clue why you brought him up. Just ignore it.
But thats just like T_D to try and blame Obama out of no where when he wasnt brought up. I guess 8 years is too much to ask for when 8 seconds is above your limit :D Reading comprehension - I know the GOP and red-states are typically more ignorant when it comes to these things, but come on, surely they teach basic reading where you are from? Why would I even expect him to fire people in Washington? You know hes not there manager or boss right lol? Jesus why am I even trying to reason with you mongrels. No I wasnt talking about that. I was talking about the things he actually has control over. Like his cabinet. So A: get back to the point I brought up. Such as, do you really think hes draining the swamp when he surrounds himself with the likes of Rick Perry? And B: You honestly think a D+ Animal Studies major should be making decisions at the nuclear level? I cant wait for your reply :) Its just funny trying to see your little brains going off trying to figure out how you can say Trump is right when all things are pointing to the fact hes making mistakes and you all got duped.
Also how is that Mexican Wall that Mexico will pay for coming he promised you guys? And that Stop and frisk? And the banning of muslims from terrorist countries? And that global warming hoax? All coming along nicely I presume? Did you guys actually the things that fell out of his mouth?
No but seriously you guys havent responded to any of the issues brought up. Kinda funny really. Is it because you know you are wrong now?

3308,"Wow bro. Take a chill pill. If you are gonna demand people give you handouts of information and explination while you obviously haven't put any effort in yourself to listen to and read the reactions of scollars and other knowledgeable people on the subject. If you demand things and do no effort you should sign up to the dmc. Do your own research we do not have to explain why we think his picks are good. I'll give you an 8second reply. They are the best of the best in their fields. And some are picked for strategic reasons. LPT dont go off on a rant ever you loose every little bit of good will anyone was ever gonna have.
"
3309,"""The Donald this, the Donald that, wiggy wiggity wack."" -- Might want to examine your prejudice here, mate. When 300,000 people are involved it's unlikely they all think exactly the same.

""Obama fixed the recession."" -- History has proven that economics function cyclically, so, literally anyone, would have fixed the recession. A more rigorous analysis shows that the economic upturn that was expected was one of underperformance. 

""Obama created jobs"" -- He created part time jobs while labour participation fell and other people simply stopped looking. Note that, given his massive government spending increases, that even the amount of part time jobs he created is not impressive or remotely remarkable. He did a sub par job at creating part time jobs while losing full time, good, jobs. 

""Trump won't drain the swamp."" -- It's simply too early to tell to what degree he will drain the swamp. But, even if he doesn't, you're aware this didn't come into his campaign until the final hour, right? Most people supporting him already supported him. My logic for why anecdotal evidence (a single selection pick, which you sem to have a hard on for) is not indicative of four year performance was already stated.

""Wall isn't built yet."" -- No shit.

I don't believe in global warming. I don't believe in the Religion of Peace. I have no problem with stop and frisk. I have no problem with financially successful government being brought in to replace a financially incompetent one.

I have responded to all of the 'issues' that I could see, you writing style is childish and incoherent, akin to that of a teenager who hasn't even kissed a woman. Every argument you have raised is used to defend the right wing government of Conservatives in my own country and they are all bullshit arguments.

Here's a piece of advice, for free: Get a fucking life. You're full of hate. You're miserable. Your demanding answers from people who don't have them, or couldn't possible forecast them, for no other reason than to shit all over a group of people. It's pathetic. You're pathetic. Laugh about that as much as you want but I'll still hear you crying."
3310,"meh. wasnt even trying to respond to you. 1 - Im not even asking for handouts of information. Im asking for their opinions. Ive tried reading both sides of the argument, but it literally hurts my heart and brain when I watch fox news. 

I just dont see how anybody in their right mind could think Rick Perry is a good pick. Hes the worst of the worst in his field. Literally studied animal science and got D's in the subject. As opposed to the current lead of the DEO who is a physicist and a scientist. Rick Perry didnt even know the department of energy even existed. Thats why I have a problem with him - Hes incredibly stupid if you just research him a bit - and now he is in charge of nuclear decisions. Scary in my opinion. 

I could go on about his tax plan that clearly targets the rich while giving a pittance to the average person. Or about all those promises he made how he is clearly backing out now.  But I dont see the point. 

You have basic manners so I dont want to argue with you lol. Dont bother replying, I just honestly think these are clear mistakes and no matter what happens I will not think giving the rich more money is beneficial.
"
3311,"Rick Perry will not be in charge of nuclear weapons maybe he might decide to get a plant build he could. 
 Hes has been picked by trump because he will put the economy and the emvironment in balance in Trumps opinion. 

The rich arent given more money. Just less of theirs is given to you and others. See the diference. And then still they pay waaaaaay more because 1 % of 30k = 300
1 % of 5milion = 50 000

A negative tweet or a twitter war between him and Arnold would shine a bright spotlight on the show and send viewers to it.  People who are automatically going to choose the opposite side from DJT on any subject might just start watching it out of spite and start giving it good reviews just because it's seen as Arnold opposing DJT.

3498,Sorry but a one income household is very difficult to maintain. My wife and I both work and do our parts in the household to make things work. Gender roles have no place in America. For example I like cooking more than my wife. If we're going to MAGA we will need the talents of all our men and women. Confining people to predetermined roles based on gender or race is how you get cucked.
3499,"I understand what you are getting at, this is deep redpill, but your concept as presented is half baked and not based on actual history and that part of the reason for the blowback you are getting.  
  
Unmarried women who owed property were entitled to vote. The reason marriage mattered is because they wanted a vote per household and voting used to be much more difficult. You had to travel, sometimes for days, to go to the polling station. It wasn't practical for the entire family to leave and go vote.  
This is why women voting was an issue; if both the husband and wife voted, breaking the cultrual norm, they effectively got two votes instead of one for their household.  
  
There's more to it, it was actually bourgeois women who opposed women's suffrage the most because they saw women's roll in society to maintain high-society and politics was beneath them. But if women were suddenly expected to vote they would all have to engage in politics to maintain parity.  
It's a bit like requiring women to register for the draft today.  
  
Your beaf is primarily with feminism which really came about much latter than suffrage. Feminism is what fills people heads with distortions from reality while also being a political force which encourages them to vote. Your argument falls apart because there are a great many men who are caught in the cuck net, it's not just women.  "

Also she got her undergrad in business administration and political science? Zero experience in education systems... This just doesn't feel like the bootstrap movement we were promised. 

""By Stephen Henderson

In Detroit, parents of school-age children have plenty of choices, thanks to the nation’s largest urban network of charter schools.

What remains in short supply is quality.

In Brightmoor, the only high school left is Detroit Community Schools, a charter boasting more than a decade of abysmal test scores and, until recently, a superintendent who earned $130,000 a year despite a dearth of educational experience or credentials.

On the west side, another charter school, Hope Academy, has been serving the community around Grand River and Livernois for 20 years. Its test scores have been among the lowest in the state throughout those two decades; in 2013 the school ranked in the first percentile, the absolute bottom for academic performance. Two years later, its charter was renewed.

Or if you live downtown, you could try Woodward Academy, a charter that has limped along near the bottom of school achievement since 1998, while its operator has been allowed to expand into other communities.

For students enrolled in schools of choice — that is, schools in nearby districts who have opened their doors to children who live outside district boundaries — it’s not much better. Kids who depend on Detroit’s problematic public transit are too far away from the state’s top-performing school districts — and most of those districts don’t participate in the schools of choice program, anyway.

This deeply dysfunctional educational landscape — where failure is rewarded with opportunities for expansion and “choice” means the opposite for tens of thousands of children — is no accident. It was created by an ideological lobby that has zealously championed free-market education reform for decades, with little regard for the outcome.

And at the center of that lobby is Betsy DeVos, the west Michigan advocate whose family has contributed millions of dollars to the cause of school choice and unregulated charter expansion throughout Michigan.""

"
3559,"Right but look at the performance of these ""School Choice"" schools in the districts that she lobbied... they're some of the worst performing schools in the country. They are not required to be held to any standards. 

However I agree that the college loans should look at obtainable positions, the average pay for these positions, and the size of the loan required to get the degree before they write them. I'm more worried about what will happen to the primary school system
"
3560,"You will have to be more specific. Of course some charter schools perform poorly nationwide, if the experiments are being conducted in the worst performing districts in the nation. How do these charter schools compare to neighboring public schools? "

3567,"Climate change is very real.  

Not sure if you are asking about Man-made Climate Change, which is horseshit."
3568,"My opinion is that climate change (carbon hysteria) is bullshit.

Once Trump withdraws from much of the UN carbon-concern cuckery and defunds most of the fraudulent 'climate science' given legitimacy by Obama during the last 8 years, America and the world will get to a better place."
3569,"The evidence that man is causing climate change doesn't totally convince me. Furthermore, even if man is causing it, I don't think the outcome will be as disastrous as they say, and I also don't think there is anything we can really do to stop it."
3570,As a full on Donald supporter I still believe climate change is real and I think it's great that he is working with Elon Musk. Trump and Musk together means that we can deal with climate change in a powerful way.
3571,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtbn9zBfJSs
3572,"The debate has never been about whether or not climate change is real.  It's about the severity of man's impact on climate change.  I think there's good evidence that man has overloaded the carbon cycle.  The earth has a tendency to compensate for imbalances though, so I don't get all doomsday about it.  

On a more practical level, if every man woman and child in the US started shutting down all utilities, riding bikes, and living in mud huts, the carbon cycle will still be overloaded.  Why gimp our economy to stop something that will continue regardless?  When and if carbon buildup starts having devastating effects on China, there might be an opportunity to bring levels down.  Until then, it's a fools errand.

But hell, maybe we'll get some good cropland in Canada.  Maybe that newly exposed cropland will pull enough CO2 out to stabilize the cycle.  Maybe plants will start growing larger with the CO2 abundance.  Who knows?

Schools struggle to provide enough resources to help non-English speakers catch up.  

Us building a wall on the southern border helps Mexico too, they have one on their southern border, helps lower the flow of unauthorized people and drugs flowing through their country.  

Lastly, building the wall provides jobs, jobs, and jobs.  Good jobs. We can work cooperatively with Mexico on better procedures and a better way to handle situations that arise, like our Marine who took a wrong turn and then spent time in jail (Andrew Tahmooressi).

I don't force Islam down anyone's throat. I support their right to practice their religion freely so long as they aren't effecting others with their practice, the same way I support any other religion. You evidently do not support this right, because it appears you are anti-freedom. 

I think all religion is stupid, but I support everyone's right to practice it. Also yeah I will point to all the fucking Bible verses that do the same things, and then I'll point to how that goddamned poison plagues your and my societies. I'll show you how teachings in the Koran are destroying middle East countries, then I'll show you how teachings in the Bible are destroying our own.

Even more hilarious is how you say ""anything left of Karl Marx"", then so many right wingers call anything left of themselves ""communism"". Fuck you right back. This terrorist was an ultra-nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, right-winger - so yeah he was one of your kind. If you still don't think so, then you'd better start proving how you're different then him. If you say ""because I don't kill people"", that's a fucking low bar to set; it's also something that could change too so keep that in mind."
3836,"Maybe you should wait until they're formally charged, or at least accused by police instead of ""suspected"". Within 24 hours news reports are completely unreliable, and everyone knows that. So once again let me reiterate - STOP JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS."
3837,"Your own admission is that you can damn them as interpretation of the Qur'an, which is the most mealy-mouthed way of trying to paint it as a fly-by-night interpretation that almost the entire Muslim world doesn't follow. Like I said, you just keep moving the goalposts to make yourself feel better about it. Your own logic would indicate that it would just be this kids interpretation of a far-right message. So there you go. And yes, people like you do shove islam down throats ibecause if we questioned  practices we're suddenly anti-immigration, anti brown people, Pro fascist dictators . It takes a special, delusional kind of hubris to come in and tell somebody they need to own the actions of someone else. Because guess what? I'm still anti-refugee. I'm still pro border. I'm still Pro Trump. If this kid is guilty of doing what he did, then he's going to suffer the consequences. But until you get to 3, 4, 5, 6 15 20 of them with every media Outlet and pseudo-intellectual internet telling you that it's
Because you're a racist that's not diverse enough? Take that sanctimonious shit back to where you came from.
"
3838,"Yeah because Islam is the only religion that creates terrorists who justify what they do with their interpretation of their holy book. Surely Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Paganism, etc never commit violent acts different from the majority and use their interpretation of their holy book to do it. There's clearly no radicals in any other religion, it's only Islam.

You scream that I can't call you bigoted, but by every definition you are a bigot:

>a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance. *Merriam-Webster*

If you want to have a conversation about why there's a higher number of radicals coming out of the Muslim religion I'll have that conversation with you. However you don't want that, all you want to do is discriminate against Muslims because they're Muslims, and then cry when I call you out on that shit. Put together an argument about why, save it in a Word document, then just paste it whenever you get into an argument with people. Keep crying every time you encounter resistance to your ideas, and yeah you're going to feel like you're persecuted. It's not because you're a Trump supporter though, it's because you're acting like an idiot."
3839,"You got me, dude. We're all NAZIs, # punchNAZIs.  I already told you. Islam is indeed an ethnic group and not one of ideological basis, and again, we all hate brown people.  Radical white converts are ok in my book, like in Scotland and the Northern U.S.  The Quran is in no way relevant to their ideological beliefs, and must be born from white privilege.  All the other religions are clearly causing the same problems, and it's just bigotry to claim otherwise.

Keep fighting the villains dude, be the hero!"
3840,"Do not put words in my mouth. I never called you a Nazi, or a racist, or anything else. I called you bigoted, which means you're stereotyping an entire group based on a subset of that group. If every single Muslim was a terrorist then you'd be right, but they aren't so you're wrong. Do not play the victim here, because the only thing you're a victim to is your own unwillingness to have a conversation with me."
3841,"Your conversation skills amount to making a neologism in order to explain away your inconsistencies. And anyone that tries to say that other religions are responsible for the same level of issues Islam is does not deserve a discussion, because you've already shown that you're willing to ignore reality. So yea, make the strawman that I'm stereotyping all Muslims based on their ideology, which in turn means I'm positive they're all terrorists, and not that the basis of their faith encourages it and they would therefore be a higher incident offender. Just, you know #punchbigots.  Frame it so that your strawman of ""all Muslims"" makes you correct, and then you can basically make any claim that you want under the assertion that I'm just a bigot. It's the leftist debate tactic made manifest.


Like I said, you are the hero in the movie. Islam is just misunderstood , and on equal footing with all religions and is in no way more of a political ideology.  Fight the bigots man, if we show enough love then the problems will go away. #Diversity is Our Strength "
3842,"Jesus you really don't want to even consider another point of view, eh? Let me explain why I take the approach towards Islam that I do.

Christianity used to be a very violent religion: Crusades, witch hunts, genocides, Inquisition, etc. ""Oh you stupid libtard, Christianity isn't anymore"". You're right, largely they appear to have solved most of their violent issues. Do you know what it took? Time, the protection of moderate Christians within city-states, and education. Christianity has existed for longer than Islam, it has existed in a more stable area politically, and it has existed in a richer area of the world. Christianity took years to solve its fucking problems, yet everyone praises them for it; like a goddamned baby taking its first steps.

You know who else used to be a violent group of people but solve their violence issues? Jews. Look in the first five books of the Bible (called the Torah in Judaism) and read about how they slaughtered people of different cultures. They certainly aren't violent now, and they haven't been considered a violent religion for years. Want to know why? They had a long period of geopolitical stability, more widespread education, and didn't discriminate against moderate Jews.

So if you want to sit there and yell at me that Muslims are violent because their books are violent, you'll forgive me if I take my lessons from history instead of some rando on Reddit with an opinion. History shows us what happens to religions when they are given political stability and education, and it's no secret that Muslim countries do not have the same level of political stability nor access to education that we in the West enjoy. Even better look at modern history. Look at Iraq in the 1970's and see what their politics were like. Then look at how they changed when the USA stuck its fucking nose where it didn't belong, like it has for so many years. When political stability collapses humanity turns to right wing, extremist governments. This combined with the relative lack of infrastructure  and society structure has allowed extremists to create groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS, as well as push a narrative of persecution by the world to help convert people to their cause....

Huh, a narrative of persecution by the world and a need to unite under a banner many consider extreme. Who else is doing that right now? *cough* *cough* DONALD TRUMP *cough* *cough*

This is why I don't discriminate against all Muslims based on what's in their book. Sure some of their writings are more extreme than those found in the Bible, yet others are less so. Also Christians freely ignore whatever the fuck they want to in the Bible, so I'm 100% confident that some reasonable Muslims will push for the exact same thing within the Muslim community if we give them enough time.

I'm not some movie hero, I'm just a critical thinker who looks at history and does his best to learn from it. I try to see everything affecting a situation, instead of pointing at the outcome and making up bullshit about how we ended up with that situation."

Why arent people taking 5 minutes out of their day to actually look into policies for themselves that Trump is acting on and toy with the idea that he truly wants to MAGA for all Americans?"
4027,"Trump doesn't have a war on journalists. He has a law on the intentionally lying press. There's a big difference there.

Dont know what you heard, Trump got upset that Malcolm was intent that these people did not go through extreme vetting, he refused to budge on that issue, Trump compounded this by being upset that Turnbull was dictating terms when the US was getting nothing in return. 

When Turnbull suggested changing subjects Trump instead opted to end the phone call having cited it was his worst call of the day.

I live here in Sydney but I think Trump is right here, he is doing MORE than his fair share honoring a deal Obama made that is the antithesis of the stuff Trump ran on, unfair for Turnbull to pull what he did. ALSO, I am a member of the liberal party and I voted for him recently, I'm happy with the job he was doing but this was Turnbull's blunder.

Get fucked, you mincy dirt bag
 You come in here stepping over the body of thousands with ""not all Muslims"" to condemn anyone that thinks securing a border against rampant illegal immigration may be a good idea the moment you think you have moral high ground. How about you own Orlando, Nice, San Bernardino, the NYC bombings, the OSU machete attack, the Florida air port shooting, the bataclan, fort Hood, or the rape, violence, and terror across Europe from your ego-driven #diversity social acceptance fetish? Or is it #not all Muslims, but definitely #all Trump supporters?  Maybe you should label more people as Nazis so you can pretend to be hero's in the movie playing in your delusional little brain. Then you can keep kidnapping mentally handicapped kids and torturing them for days because you assume they are Trump Nazis. Oh, you don't think that's part of your message? What about cop killing? No? That's what you're all about, though, right?

Stop generalizing people. That's part of the fucking problem. You just want more people to blame for the actions of a radical. We don't support this fucking lunatic's actions, and we won't take the blame or be made to feel guilty because of him. We support President Trump. "

4395,"One thing I hate about the current environment now is that EVERYTHING is reported with a biased angle. 

For instance, those pages on whitehouse.gov you're talking about were part of Obama's personal section specific to his presidency, largely fluff that doesn't outline specific policy or law. It's possible it was even removed by his staffers as part of their departure. But it was reported as if Donald came in and just erased it all.

So, as for the gag orders on the EPA (didn't hear about FDA myself) it's possible I totally disagree, but it's all been framed from the start in a partisan way so I don't feel the need to get up in arms about it until I know what the reality is. And given how EVERYTHING has been reported since election season, I'm willing to give the benefit of a doubt."
