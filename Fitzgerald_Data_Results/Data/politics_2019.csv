21,"""Trump’s foreign policy, aside from the taint from his subservience to Russia, is characterized as chaotic, frightening and entirely ineffective."" It's more than this-Trump's foreign policy has weakened the United States on the world stage. The smart despots are holding themselves back, waiting to see what happens in 2020. Exploiting the fake news fallacy is a start for them, but they know they could be facing a resurgent US under a new potus in no time. A potus that actually leads and surrounds themself with world-savvy advisers. One that doesn't fart ketchup onto prime cut steaks, one that has normal sized hands."
22,Yea I have trouble believing he's going to make it that long. Things are spinning out of his control.
23,Not me.  I want zero chance of a pardon from Pence.

29,"He's not getting the wall from the house or our taxes. He's gonna have to declare the ""emergency"" and watch it slowly die in the courts while Mueller grinds him and his associates down to a paste."
30,"Yeah, but if it waited the last five weeks and it can wait another three, it’s not really an emergency kind of emergency, is it? I think this dumb stunt has burned through quite a lot of his political capital with the GOP."

This is an environmental science (and marine bio) teacher with a phd, and she's probably gonna get fired because a student that had previously started a crisis over an expensive bracelet that she accidentally left at her vacation house doesn't give a shit about the environment."
37,They’re certainly not following the teachings of Christ in that video. Disgusting behavior from the MAGA crowd. 
38,I wanna know where the faculty chaperones were when this happened.  There's a guy with a white MAGA hat and a mustache in the video that looks like he belongs in the Proud Boys.  What's going to happen to the adults that allowed this sort of behavior?

48,School that teaches children to be racist hate machines should lose its credentials and be shut down. 
49,"Good. They should be, self righteous little pricks."
50,"Nathan Philips, the Native American was the aggressor who went up to the kid. It's all in the video and Philips has done this before. The media does not have an ounce of integrity in reporting the truth. The kid, at worst, is guilty for smiling and standing still.

51,Good
52,What about the other students? 
53,"Catholic? Well, that figures!"
54,What did the school expect? They were practicing what they have been taught. 
55,"The catholic school has said the students could be expelled, but the same school will continue to teach its students to hate LGBT people and discriminate against their LGBT employees."
56,"It's not just the students who need to be disciplined. The ""adults"" who were present as chaperones who need to be, as well. Whomever the school representative who was in charge of this trip is, that person should be fearing for their job. The parents who were along? They should never be allowed to chaperone again, assuming their little ""darlings"" aren't expelled."
57,"And it turns out to be fake news.... But of course people would just take it as fact without checking the truth. So sad that America can be so easily divided with rumors and fake news from irresponsible sources. Melting pot my ass...

58,fuck them students.. but not like how Catholics do it.
59,Can someone tell me what the kids did wrong? They were sitting off to the side when the dude came up and started banging the drum in their face. they weren't blocking anything. What is all the outrage for?

77,It’s not on victims of racism to coddle racists.

83,Yes being completely dehumanized and losing your freedom is comparable to a private institution no longer allowing an individual to be a part of it. I can see where you are coming from in theory but when looking at the reality of the two situations it’s kind of absurd to equate them like that.

86,"They're not going to get sued by the students or their parents.

Kids are expelled for fucking up on field trips even when there isn't actual video.

They and their parents all signed code of conduct waivers in order to participate in the field trip and not do anything that reflects poorly upon the school or the Church.

There will be expulsions, the parents have no leg to stand on.

There is no ""right"" to a private education.

91,"I dont know, im genuinely confused at this point. I skipped through the video but saw the Native American walk up to the kid and get in his face chanting. 

Edit: did the kids have thier bus stop set up purposefully there knowing AIM would march through that spot?"
92,"I saw the longer video and I don't know what you mean? People keep referencing it though like no one's going to watch that long ass video but I did and there's nothing in it that justifies their behavior. 

These are shithead children, normal children get expelled every day for less...what makes these kids different? "
93,"Uh, that's a bit extreme."
94,"I agree with this.  MAGA hats are getting awful close to the Nazi Swastika with how they’ve been used by alt-right groups lately.  Throw them out for owning the fuckin hat.  It’s not funny, it’s not “expressing a political opinion” of which these kids’ don’t matter if their only plan is to stand in front of people who actually did something positive for America, it’s fuckin sad and racist and intolerant and it’s a tool used to incite anger in people who believe in the right things America needs.

106,"They're from a Catholic school, and can be seen in their clothes. I think it's a relevant detail."
107,"Being part of that group is what emboldened them. Those hats give them an identity and justification for their behavior. Their religion is important because of the hypocrisy and because it causes the larger group they are representing (by their presence at the pro-life march) to hold them accountable. 

The church has already apologized for them. Sometimes context is important. "
108,you do realize these are not black muslims and they were preaching the bible and were talking down to the Indians for not believing in God. The children mistook them for Muslims and confronted both groups

118,"Chanting ""build the wall"" and mocking and laughing at a Native American vet as he peacefully played his drum.  Not to mention the asshole kid that got in his face.  Those dipshits never should have been allowed to wear MAGA hats to a pro-life rally to begin with.  They're high schoolers.  I've been to the March for Life when I was in high school.  We had to dress up and act appropriately.  Obviously this school DGAF.  They were harassing African-Americans which is why the patriot with the drum stepped in to draw their attention.

126,And look at all the upvotes you’ve gotten for these beautiful comments.  Listen brother if it’s in the negative in a predominantly well informed and intelligent community like reddit....you’re fuckin wrong.
127,did anyone answer it? link me if so. feels like nobody actually watched any of the footage
128,yup the longer video changes practically nothing. citing it is just trying to cast doubt and confusion because they know no one has the time to watch it. sad.

148,That's certainly not true.
149,What is your argument? The video clearly shows the guy with the drum approached them. What is all the outrage about?
150,"Worse, it tries to justify their behavior because of the black protestors who were calling them racist and homophobic names. It’s two wrongs make a right, water muddying bullshit that 6 year olds should be able to see through"

166,i don't think anyone watched the video
167,"Bad parenting is the cause.  These kids should have walked away, but instead of ushering them 100 feet the parents sray passively by.  That is encouraging the event.  Way to teach kids how to behave in the nations capital.  "

172,"Everyone watched the video.  And a smug little shit got in the way of a march for indigenous peoples, a group that is constantly forgotten in this country.  A group that I can only assume was marching to the steps of the Lincoln Monument in DC that everyone else claims approached the little Kavanaugh in the video.  Well yes, he certainly did approach the kid in front of a monument to a man that helped free the slaves and gave a shit about the rights of people, not the rights of races.  "

179,"Oh I watched and so did everyone else, and you 5% of delusional idiots are what’s left disagreeing with the points the other 95% makes.  Don’t be a little shit, let the god damn Native American Vietnam War Veteran through, as he sings a song of peace to the monument I am certain was his end point for the march.  When the fuck are you disgusting people going to stop and think it’s not about politics, it’s about letting people do what they want and demonstrate how they want and send their message through legal means, *however they want*.  Send your message if you want by all means, but get the fuck off Twitter/Reddit and go march if you’re so passionate about it, don’t stand in the way of those that have pride and show their passion over something, smiling and laughing and making fun of Veterans, just because you want to get in the way.

182,"Unless their sole purpose is to stand in the way of fucking equality.  Then yes.  And if you recall, those Maga hat wearing douchebags are the same brand of asshole that ran a truck through people on Charlottesville, and sent bombs to everyone on Trump’s twitter feed, and elected a fucking Russian puppet to president who is ruining the country.  So you’re god damn right unless they have Maga hats on.  In that case they should be considered enemies of the state and deported or prosecuted for treason at this point.  30% of this country, whatever amount still applies as Trump’s base, I’d like to see you and the rest of them shipped off to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and then we’ll talk about how the MAGA caravan isn’t allowed in this country.

But think about Trump, the only thing he cares about is his base, this is an address to his base, so he is going to explain to his base why he is going to put the wall funding on hold, and at the same time claim victory, because “the wall is already mostly built” or something like that."

I see everyone teaming up and isolating and that is not progressive. Its the opposite in fact. 

There is a lot I like on the left as and independent but imo the left handles two concepts horribly: Dealing with bigotry and gun control. Both concepts are ruled by emotion on the left and not logic or common sense and wild unproven accusations are made all the time. Also, the whole ""court of public opinion"" ruining lives is mostly from the left deciding that one, just ONE, bad moment should define us all and end our livelihoods. Some people got what they deserved, a lot were put through hell and then even when proven innocent still just not believed. 

If you cannot see the fallacy in heading in that kind of direction, then we are not on the same page. I want true equality for everyone which means no advantages or disadvantages. A true level playing field. Neither the left nor the right seem to want that so imo, both sides are making the bigotry issue worse and not better."

Yet they never discuss a single possible alternative, let alone propose or even *negotiate* politically on any of these options.  Their followers have never even heard of them.  Instead, they regularly and persistently lie about well known facts.

So, they use abortion as a political cudgel, they hide from solutions, and lie about well known facts. 

AND - their (claimed) positions are morally inconsistant  with regard to other issues. They don't interrogate these issues or their foundation of belief.

Rural voters like him because he is a white republican, urban African American voters like him because he is an [actual human being who dealt with the Baltimore riots well](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/once-wary-black-voters-have-warmed-up-to-republican-larry-hogan-in-maryland/2018/10/29/a6e1ede2-d631-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html?utm_term=.715a98e71888), and suburban middle class voters like him because he's a critic of Trump who has lowered tolls, raised speed limits on I-70, and funded Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts.

So far he has been almost the perfect politician: one you never hear from unless there's a problem, in which case he is responding effectively to the problem. I think the biggest scandal of his administration was when his social media director blocked some people on Facebook during his first campaign.

We also go to the same dentist, and I don't go to a fancy-pants dentist."

381,"So whats the standard?  You must be a dem for x number of years, or your entire life, or your whole family must have been a dem to be part eligible to run.  I guess same day registration or changing your party is no longer acceptable?"

384,Wow we can learn so much from your unsourced screen shot. Did you make that spreadsheet yourself?
385,"Does that say Biden has 64% favorability? 

I’m not sure about this, please correct me if I’m wrong — but I think 64% is higher than 60% (?). 


Also noteworthy that Bernie has the lowest percentage of people who are unsure, which makes sense given his high name recognition. All the others, except for Biden, have pretty high percentages of people unsure, which makes sense given their comparatively lower name recognition. As those candidates become more known, it’s unlikely that Bernie will remain the second most favorable to this group of voters. 
"
386,"Fair and don't mean to overly take out frustration on you.  Age for Biden and Bernie is a fair question.  But there is a definite pattern that any even respectfully asked question in a thread for Beto, Harris, Klochubar, etc. is met with accusations of Bernie Bro division (and for the record I like and support all three of them - I am not even the one asking the questions).   But people will come into the Bernie threads (especially posters from Enough Sanders Spam) and will say vile things or bet him no to run and clutch their pearls when being accused of causing the same disunity they accuse others of.

But again, it maybe a fair and well-intentioned statement on your part.  That said, no reason to not have him run.  If he's the best candidate and can beat Trump - even 4 years of Bernie paving the way for a younger VP of his like Beto or Harris - could be 4 of the most important years this country has ever seen.  Certainly would be the most progressive President we have had in my lifetime.     "

473,Someone told me this before. National guard is made up of statesmen. Military is federal. Stationing military active duty troops is a very different thing from national guard. Obama did not sent active duty troops to the border. He sent national guard. Conflating the two is an error. It is not normal to send US armed forces there.
474,"Your article says he sent military to the border in 2010, but we are talking about the immigration crisis in 2014 when a bunch of unaccompanied minors were fleeing violence and coming to America.

Why did Obama send the national guard in 2010?  To appease Republican demands before they could discuss immigration reform.

> TUCSON, Ariz.  — President Barack Obama on Tuesday ordered 1,200 National Guard troops to boost security along the U.S.-Mexico border, pre-empting Republican plans to try to force votes on such a deployment.

>Obama will also request $500 million for border protection and law enforcement activities, according to lawmakers and administration officials.

>The president announced the deployment shortly after he returned from lunch with the 41-member Senate Republican Caucus, who told him that U.S. borders first need to be secured before work could start on a sweeping overhaul of U.S. immigration laws.  Arizona's two Republican senators said the deployment wasn't enough.

475,"The National Guard is ""military"" and a part of the ""US Armed Forces.""  Its leadership is classified as ""mixed"" between the federal and state government.  Every single National Guardsman is a member of both their state Guard and the (federal) National Guard of the United States.  I'm not sure what the big difference is that you claim to see, but at any rate OP is most definitely incorrect in saying that Obama only deployed ""lawyers and paralegals"" to the border."

494,"A brief History of relevant global awareness of American Shame & Pride:


Huge Major Pride Period
1945-1950:

* America has just help stop war & genocide.  Nuremberg trials/crimes against humanity concept, UN, Marshall Plan, etc.


*Shame:*

* 1950's-1970's: Korea, Vietnam, Civil Rights Opposition, Cambodia, Laos, Watergate.

Major counter event: 

* *1965 Civil Rights Act*  Mixed results, as those opposed remain influential, even taking White House in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000, 2004, 2016.


1980's: 

* Iran Contra: Reagan/Bush administration trades weapons for hostages, arms terrorists in Nicaragua & the Middle East, arms both Iran & Iraq *even though they are fighting each other.*

Major Reversal Event:

* https://youtu.be/GCO9BYCGNeY. Mixed Results, as this was Reagan.


1990's: Major Reversal Events: 

*  US helps South Africa become a democracy & end Apartheid.  Clinton successfully leads military interventions in Yugoslavia, helping stop war & genocide again.

2000's:

* US invades Iraq on a lie, turns terrorism into Jihadism, expanding its range & influence.  Abu Graib.    Guantanamo.  Katrina response. 


2008: 

* Bush creates conditions for a preventable global economic crash (now white washed as a ""recession"").


Major Reversal Event:

*  Election of Obama.  Mixed results as Republicans begin to hold government hostage & a conservative military intentionally allows ISIS to grow for electoral advantage of their party.

2016 - present: 

* Donald Trump colludes with Russia & global conservatives to steal election.  *Trump wrecks everything*.

Only by making the cost of employing illegals too high will illegal immigration actually be stopped, not by building any number of Walls.

The article fails to mention anything about the $5 billion being a mere down payment on the many billions more it would take to finish the kind of wall that would be needed to actually prevent illegal crossings (which it also doesn't mention are already at an 18 year low).

Those votes matter and say more about his personal views and what will endear him to the moneyed class, not what represents his constituents.  Of course we should be critical, he deserves it.

Subs like Late Stage Capitalism, Bernie 4 President,  The Donald, Beto 2020, etc. are not subs meant for anyone to come into and ask the same 5 questions or make the same 5 gotcha challenges over and over again.  It's one of my pet peeves when people go to these subs, post a bad-faith question and then get upset and complain about free speech or call the subs snowflakes.  

If you want to debate Biden versus Bernie versus Beto versus Warren - there's a lot of subs (including this one) to do that.  If you want to debate the practical application of capitalism versus socialism versus communism, there's a million places to do that.  But some subs are meant to be place where people can organize and pursue a common goals without getting bogged down in constant debate and trolling.  

It's the equivalent of walking into a church or temple during a service, shouting at the priest / rabbi about why their religion is wrong and then when you get kicked out complaining that they are snowflakes who refuse to debate the merit of their ideas.  No, it's about understanding context and finding the right  place and time to discuss and debate.  And if you are picking an organizational sub, you are right to get banned.

While I will happily vote for Beto if he wins the nomination, I do have questions about him that are likely to prevent him from being my first choice in the primary.  Those discussions belong on this sub, in real life conversations, etc.  But going into the Beto sub where they are sharing information, answering good faith questions, and organizing fundraising / phone banks / etc. and demanding answers is simply inappropriate.  Just as it is in the Bernie sub, Biden sub, and even the Trump sub."

Biden is leading in multiple different polls by a large margin and yet, I see no strong support for him and instead people here are fighting between Beto & Bernie.

>The idea that 'dual loyalty' is anitsemitic is antisemitic. It is suggesting that Jews aren't allowed to have more than one loyalty but all other races/religions are. I proudly support both the United States and Israel. 

I can understand where you're coming from, but with all due respect, accusations of dual loyalty against jews is a old trope, and you really should appreciate the danger of the accusation more. In the Soviet Union they banned jews from having jobs in the government that dealt with diplomacy and statecraft because they didn't trust them. In Germany, well you know...

>But I also know that the bill they want to pass regarding bans on BDS is completely unconstitutional.

It actually might not be, since the state and federal governments have a lot of due prerogative for who they can contract with and what criteria they might levy for those contracts. It's a bill that might get legally challenged and played out in the courts, but it isn't necessarily unconstitutional. To be clear, these bills don't ban private groups  and individuals from boycotting a country, they merely prohibit the government from contracting companies and subcontractors which are taking part in a specific boycott movement ([which you should know has ties to terrorist groups](https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/263409/bds-umbrella-group-linked-to-palestinian-terrorist-organizations)). A lot of the reporting on the bills and legislation has been sloppy, and if you look at the actual bills you'll see that they've been mischaracterized in the press, possibly for click bait purposes.

Here is the [ACLU's very well educated opinion on the matter](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/rights-protesters/new-israel-anti-boycott-act-still-unconstitutional). It's long so I added bold to the most important parts. 

>The Israel Anti-Boycott Act seeks to amend a 1970s law known as the Export Administration Act. That law was passed in response to the Arab League’s boycott of Israel, which required U.S. businesses to boycott Israel as a condition of doing business with Arab League countries. To prevent foreign countries from bullying U.S. businesses into these compulsory boycotts, the EAA prohibited U.S. companies from entering into agreements with foreign governments to boycott countries friendly to the United States. **Whereas the EAA was meant to protect U.S. companies from these compulsory boycotts, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act seeks to dictate the political activities Americans can and can’t engage in. It does so by imposing civil and criminal penalties on American organizations that participate in political boycotts called for by international organizations**.

>The revised Israel Anti-Boycott Act, amended by Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), does contain several significant improvements from the original draft. For example, the bill now makes clear that Americans cannot be imprisoned for their boycott participation. It also provides that speech critical of Israel cannot be used to open an investigation against an individual or as evidence that the person violated the law. These changes alleviate some of the gravest dangers posed by the bill.

>This latest version would still allow people who boycott to be slapped with criminal financial penalties. **It suffers from the same fundamental flaw as the original draft by criminalizing participation in constitutionally protected boycotts.** In fact, the bill’s sponsors openly admit that it was designed for this purpose. In the press release accompanying its announcement, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) described the bill as an attempt to “combat Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) efforts targeting Israel.” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) also characterized the bill as “anti-BDS legislation.” Although the bill states that “[n]othing in this Act . . . shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment,” these words rings hollow in light of the bill’s obvious purpose.

>The Israel Anti-Boycott Act cannot be viewed in isolation. It is part of a sustained legislative campaign in the state and federal governments to suppress boycotts of Israel. **Just a few weeks ago, a federal court in Kansas agreed with the ACLU’s First Amendment challenge to a law requiring state contractors to certify that they are not participating in boycotts of Israel. The court recognized that the Kansas state government could not constitutionally suppress our client’s boycott to silence one side in the public debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.**  In halting enforcement of the law, the court held that our client’s boycott of Israel:

>“is protected for the same reason as the boycotters’ conduct in [NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware] was protected. . . . Namely, its organizers have banded together to express collectively their dissatisfaction with the injustice and violence they perceive, as experienced by both Palestinian and Israeli citizens.”"

She said  no such thing. Quote me the part of the article where she says she's loyal to the west bank over this country.

Her criticism is directed at a group of politicians and their explicit, voluntary actions. If ***some*** of them happen to be Jewish, her criticism doesn't automatically become anti-semitism. That's like saying if someone is a bully, it's anti-semitic to call them a bully or to stand up to them if they're Jewish.

All you're doing is watering down what anti-semitism means. You are basically saying that we cannot criticize Jewish people for anything without it being anti-semitic, even if their action has nothing to do with being Jewish.

See above. Just because some are Jewish doesn't mean we can't criticize any of their actions, even the non-Jewish ones, without it being anti-semitic.

No, that is what you are doing by saying that any dual-loyalty antisemitism is not because the person said it about a larger subset of peoples whom include Jews.

The constitution enshrines our ability to exercise rights without backlash from the government. This law metes out punishment from the government for private companies exercising a constitutionally protected right. It's a pretty clear constitutional violation.

I'm not seeing how she's saying she will be loyal to them over the people who voted for her. She's pretty clearly saying she will be a voice for people who are being downtrodden by others that our current government supports without question. That's part of her job as a federal representative. If she ran and was elected on a platform of helping to solve the issues between Israelis and Palestinians, then her trying to give voice to those who have none is not a negative. She's not saying she will trod over the constitution to do it, like the politicians who are saying they will punish companies who exercise their constitutional rights.

> You can be non-Jew but still have antisemitism happen to you.

I won't argue with you there. I still remember when Sikhs and Hindus were attacked after 9/11 because rednecks didn't know the difference between Muslims and Sikhs/Hindus.

> Jews are victims of more hate crimes then all other minorities combined in NYC. You are going to have to realize that you are playing it fast and loose by watering down antisemitism to just being a nuisance.

I'm not saying it's a nuisance. It's a very real problem. I don't disagree with you there. My stance is that the government trying to pass legislation that violates the constitution in order to protect Israel from negative economic impacts is wrong, calling it wrong is not anti-semitism, and calling it anti-semitism waters it down and engenders exasperation in  people who are paying attention.

Anti-semitism exists. Criticism of US politicians, be they Jewish or not, who are trying to violate the basic principles of the US constitution is not anti-semitism.

> Many of these Jews don't witness antisemitism because they dont dress Jewish or goto Synagogue. Therefore dont know what the threat is.

Ah, so they're not Jewish enough to have an  opinion here. Gotcha. This is some major /r/gatekeeping on your part. You don't get to decide that Jews are not allowed an opinion on anti-semitism because you think they don't have enough experience  in being persecuted. Now all you're doing is pulling a variation of the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy: they're not Jewish enough and so they're not qualified to talk about anti-semitism.

> Antisemitism is skyrocketing and it is important to stand up. Jews say Never forget, I am not forgetting.

918,"Yes, it's certainly not like China first tested it out with emissions trading in a few markets to see how it performed, and it's certainly not like [anyone else can check](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-02/china-s-carbon-emissions-may-have-peaked-as-climate-policy-bites) the level of carbon dioxide emissions from China.

And it's certainly not like China has some kind of vested interest in addressing climate change because it's going to be especially vulnerable to the projected future changes or anything.

You just reposted the ozone link, but I'm guessing you're talking about the 2008 scandal... that resulted in multiple criminal prosecutions and even executions.

I'm perfectly willing to criticize China, and I'm not going to defend their shitty practices or human rights abuses, but you're just using poisoning the well to assert - without any evidence relevant to that claim - that Chinese emissions enforcement is worthless."

932,"I thought you said it was the jobs guarantee, not a collapse in the value of currency? "
933,"No, but they certainly take a laissez faire approach to food and product safety testing.  They also choose to not enforce laws that are inconvenient to the growth of their economy.  

Let me out it a different way... Remember when the Wells Fargo scandal happened and all the executives said they had no idea what was happening... Bankers we're opening fraudulent accounts on their own accord?

I am sure you would call BS.  That they created a system such that anyone that wanted to succeed in their system had to commit fraudulent acts without ever telling them to so I writing.  They then purposefully created a distance so as to pretend they were not aware of the situation.

This is how the Chinese government works.  They are not fundementally honest."
934,"I'm trying to say that China is not trustworthy.  They pick and choose what laws to enforce as they see fit when they feel like it.  The Chinese government historically has had no problem violating law in the name of boosting their economy.   The whole premise of their cap and trade program is that you can trust anything reported by companies in their country and trust the enforcement of their officials.

If China's pollution crackdown is smoke and mirrors and we crack down harshly here... We will only serve to export our pollution (as we have done in the past) to China.  We must tie any emission reduction here to reductions over seas and maintain that it is verifiably occurring.

940,"You missed the point entirely...  Your thesis that the USA has abolished all environmental law is dramatic and not based in any fact.   It's useful to travel the world a little bit and see other countries.  The air quality in China and India is abysmal.  I also recommend reading up on the state of various forms of pollution around the world.  Heavy metal pollution, co2, trash,  industrial chemicals, farm fishing, forest destruction, and habitat loss around the world.  A myopic view on this subject centered on co-opting it as a weapon against a political administration does the cause no good.  This isn't a USA issue, it's not just an issue for the last 2 years, it will continue as an issue after a democrat's is put in office, and it's not going to get fixed by shifting our production to China (as we've been doing for the last 30 years).

I can't believe the environmental movement has deluded itself in to thinking flattening the growth of US CO2 emissions while China's has exponentially grown to a level twice that of ours as they've taken over all our heavy industry as some sort of victory.  "
941,"Im trying to say we all drink from the same well.  If you have two latrines dumping waste in the well... One owned by an honest person and the other owned by a businessman with a long history of lying for a buck... Set up a law that all latrine waste has to be disinfected before being dumped in to the well while making sure the honest person has enforcement from an honest agent while the dishonest owner has his latrine monitored by his hand picked agents.... What do you think will happen?  The dishonest owner will charge half the price for his latrine.. the honest owner will be put out of business... Same shit in the well... And all you have left to work with is a dishonest owner with more power.

You have to enact policy that will achieve the results you intend (reducing global pollution).  Not a vanity policy to move pollution from the USA to China and declare victory.

"
942,"There are two unfortunate truths of homelessness that people have to be willing to face:

- The ""homeless industry"" eats the money, not the homeless. Most of the time, it costs significantly more to house a homeless person than it costs a person to house themselves - and that cost is a direct result of an entire industry that exploits the issue of homelessness to keep itself going. When people are quoting figures like $475,000/bed, that's not going to homeless people - it's going to the apparatus that erects shelters so unlivable that most homeless people wouldn't go there even in dire circumstances.

- The nicer you are, the worse it gets. There are all sorts of homeless people. There are plenty of homeless people who live almost invisibly, never bothering you and never causing a mess or committing crimes. But they're not the kind of homeless people that go to a place like Venice Beach. The kind of homeless people who go to a place like Venice Beach go there because they don't want to live invisibly, never bothering anyone and never causing a mess or committing crimes. They go there because that's the kind of place they can live the way they want.

And, yes, those 'bad' homeless drive out the 'good' homeless. After all, as bad as that mess and crime is for housed people who can simply call the police, it's even worse for homeless people who can't call them without risking what minimal setup they do have.

The real solution doesn't involve massive boondoggles that promise to solve the problem while just delivering ridiculously overpriced housing that no one wants to use. It starts by insisting that homeless people adhere to reasonable standards of behavior while also recognizing that they're not vermin to simply be cast aside. It starts by providing ways to access critical services like mail, banking, identification, showers, laundry and storage without shackling these to a one-size-fits-all solution that acts primarily as a jobs program for social workers rather than a real remedy for homelessness.

Ultimately, it starts by understanding that 'homelessness' is not one problem but a wide variety of individual problems that don't need grandiose solutions."

She was never my first choice, and I wasn't pleased having her run against Trump. It's not that she doesn't have an immaculate resume, as she's arguably more qualified than anyone to be there, but that without a Democrat control of the senate AND house, anything labeled ""Clinton"" (and those bitter fuckers will label EVERYTHING on her) it'll be the same old tune with probably a little more stank on it.

He continued Bush policies of regime change but used proxies to carry it out. And he tried, repeatedly, to cut SS and Medicare as part of a ""grand bargain"" with John Boehner. 

Nobody wants to go back to that, that's part of the reason we have Trump (who of course is doing the same exact things and calling it ""nationalism"")."

She is an incredibly intelligent person, regardless of what happened in 2016 she is smart enough to know she couldn’t win in 2020.

Perhaps this is true. However, I have yet to see any evidence of it. I may be more shielded than others having been educated and working in Seattle and the Bay Area because the democrats I know, even the extremely wealthy ones, know that tax cuts for the rich are not the answer. I have also not seen anything in the ""Liberal Media"" that has given Schultz's potential candidacy anything more than a laugh.

There are very few ""old school moderate Republicans"" who are pro-choice, pro gay-rights and pro-environment....very few.  The only issue an old school moderate Republican might have in common with Schultz is pro-immigration.

1222,OK. I'm new here and still getting the hang of it.  Is there anyway to fix my submission?
1223,"Sure! If it hasn't been submitted yet, you can submit it with the exact title from the article (6 Takeaways From the Mitch McConnell Profile). Assuming it meets the other sidebar rules then you wouldn't have a problem."
1224,"Yes, because Trump’s problem all along has been his habit of holding back."
1225,As in go full Mussolini? 
1226,This hasn't been a common topic for Christie. Maybe he's baiting Trump to go off the rails?
1227,"Yes, show America how crazy he really is. He should share his Russian stories while he’s at it "
1228,He should resign.
1229,Isn’t that what he’s been doing already?
1230,When the fuck has he ever kept it tight?
1231,Let's not give Christie any attention. They're planting seeds for when Trump gets primaried.
1232,"he thinks trump should be looser in his speech

his statements so far are too tame/controlled


chris fails to see this---it's a problem for trump

when he reads from a teleprompter he's terrible---trump knows it for sure

when he wings it---it only appeals to his base---it embarrasses and or angers everyone else

he can't sway public opinion in either manner


and that's trump's problem here--he's not capable of winning anyone over at this point


his sales abilities are more limited than he would have you think

and he's incapable of making a deal as the dems know he can't be trusted

he's done this all to himself 
"
1233,Christie: I got mocked on national TV by Colbert this week and I didn't even realize it.
1234,[deleted]
1235,"Yes, please. Rave, slobber, jump the rails."
1236,I would love for Trump to shit his pants on national television too!
1237,"Coming from a guy who was petty enough to purposefully screw traffic at the GW Bridge during morning rush hour, it might not be useful advice.  "
1238,"I hope he does go off teleprompter often. Let mainstream America get a load of ""rally"" Trump. It'll further cement his disapproval."
1239,By 'let loose' do you meant fart very loud and hard for a prolonged period of time?
1240,"yea, taking any advice from the most disliked Governor in history based on the lowest polls in modern history, would be a bad idea.  I feel like Christie is trolling Trump with this suggestion for all the degrading and embarrassing shit Trump did to Christie before Pence was picked and the humiliation of ordering the meatloaf, the thousand-yard stare into oblivion as Trump touted crazy talk. 

Also noteworthy, the State of the Union is in the Constitution - to suggest that Trump turn it into a rally more than he already has in the past? Fuck that.  Fuck that twice, in the ass with no lubrication it's so bad of an suggestion.

This friggen Christie book tour putting him on the airwaves is annoying. His smug ""I've known Donald for 17 years, he's my friend"" bullshit is just... I want him to be as irrelevant as he was before and just go back into obscurity and only be in the news for having an outburst in an Italian mom and pop restaurant in a strip mall outside of Jersey City because his linguini with clam sauce was not al dente. "
1241,Is anyone concerned he would use this speech to declare the national emergency?
1242,"That rare moment when I agree with Christie Kreme - by all means, let's hear Don from Queens let loose. Watching the Republicans cringe their old white faces into looking even more like puckered assholes will be entertaining, he'll alienate more voters, the markets will tank...solid plan."
1243,Whip out Mr. Toad and just start pissing on Pelosi's desk.
1244,"I assume he means to be a tactless asshole, Trump already does that. It's strange, Christie and other Republicans, love talking shit when no one can do anything about them. Had they said any of the things they said to a regular person, they would get their teeth kicked in"
1245,I'm putting my money on Trump calling a national emergency at the SOTU.
1246,If he does let loose I hope he’s booed.
1247,Explosive Big Mac diarrhea? 
1248,He’s been holding back this far?
1249,Dana Perino. The person in the Bush administration who didn't know what the Cuban missile crisis was.
1250,I hope it's an incoherent disaster
1251,Last thing anyone in that room wants or needs is big Mac farts
1252,"That will work to fire up his base, but so what? His base is loyal. It's the rest of America, some 70% of us, that see him (and them) for the traitorous loon he  is and they are."
1253,let loose? a fart?
1254,The networks should carry it on delay and fact check as he goes.
1255,"Trump steps up to the mic, proceeds to fart out the Star Bangled Banner. The crowd is astonished but everyone agrees, the state of the union is complete shite. "
1256,"*Please proceed, Mr President.*

1257,Only on paying his bills
1258,I took it as if he has to rip one on stage then just rip one. It’s unhealthy to hold it in.
1259,"No, MacDonald-rhea."
1260,I'll see you at the nearest streetlight 
1261,His bowels...let loose his bowels.
1262,"I was just wondering the same thing. Whatever his other faults, Christie doesn't seem like a dumb guy, and he clearly loathes Kushner, and Trump has shown him no loyalty, so why should he offer any good advice to Trump? Maybe he hopes a meltdown during the SOTU will harm Trump even more. "
1263,[removed]
1264,What’s that you said ? Re-sign for the presidency . Where’s my sharpie
1265,His wallet with contractors.
1266,"> Christie can mount a comeback though

No.  No, he can't.  He failed in New Hampshire.  A state he spent more time at in 2015 than he did Jersey, as Governor while addressing the opioid epidemic.  The man is disliked, unwanted and should just crawl back to whereever it is he slithered out from.  

IF he ever goes to the Jersey Shore on a holiday weekend again, people around him should stand, point and shame him until he leaves for shutting down the beaches as he did.  Fuck that fuckin' fuck."
1267,Thats all he does when he talks anyway except its not nearly as funny as a loud fart.  
1268,"""Christie trumps; Trump trumps"" 

(I mean the first usage like [this](https://www.tremr.com/johncrapper/what-does-trump-mean-in-british-slang) and the second usage like [this](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trump).

1269,Or criticizing Putin 
1270,"That’s so unfair. He’s also held back on all of the following, on multiple occasions:

-	Being a loving father (x5)
-	Being a faithful husband (x3)
-	Being honest and forthright (x ∞)
-	Keeping his businesses out of bankruptcy proceedings (x6)
-	Keeping his campaign promises (x1000s)

He shows so much restraint. Nobody has more restraint than him, believe me folks. 👌"
1271,I laughed.  Why do fart jokes reduce us to giggling kids....

1275,"Universal jokes are the best ones, they transcend language "

1284,"Ignoring Trump’s many many affairs and child molestation is rich white male privilege.

Fuck off Dailywire."
1285,"Lol trump supporters bringing it up by turning a blind eye to the man ho in the WH. Typical.

Black dems scare the crap out of them.

Every time I bring up Dump’s affairs to a Trump supporter, they always say, “We don’t care about what he does in his personal life”. Yet anytime a dem does something, repubs never let it go. 

There was an article in the right wing Daily Mail today about how Harris wants Medicare for All. So many comments were saying she is, “EVIL!” for wanting universal coverage. These people are something else..."
1286,"Donald Trump raped a thirteen year old girl and his ex-wife.

He's very likely molested Ivanka and worse.

1289,No it's just hypocritical and stupid. 
1290,Posting the Daily Wire is idiotic.

1293,So much garbage being posted today...big Mueller news must be coming. 
1294,"Right-wing tools at Daily Wire are cheerleaders for an orange guy whose multiple affairs they have excused.  Accordingly, the Daily Wire is hypocritical for criticizing Kamala for an affair."

1296,"Having multiple children with multiple wives, and banging porn stars, is where it’s at, right fellas?"
1297,"I really wish people would criticize kamala Harris on policy, because there are things you can criticize her on that are legitimate. For example, she defends civil forfeiture, a practice which has been shown to be used almost exclusively against poor people and black people. The default democratic position is that civil forfeiture should be struck down, yet Harris supports it. This is valid criticism. There are other things like this that we can criticize her on.

Democrats don't need this hackey attack shit. There are legitimate criticisms of her which will prevent me from voting for her. I don't need to hear this. "
1298,It is

1302,No it’s not 
1303,Yawn. Low energy
1304,"It should help her with Republicans. They seem to support adulterers quite strongly - Trump, Gingrich, Guiliani, Vitter, et. al. "
1305,"Why are there 200k ""people"" online?"

1307,"It is sexist, but I'm not going to agree with the daily liar. "

1311,whataboutwhataboutwhatabout
1312,I have no reason to believe that Ben Shapiro fucks goats. 
1313,"Fair. But you have to criticize their party for endorsing an adulterer in order to call them hypocritical. And if you're doing that as a proxy defense of an adulterer who is the target of that hypocritical criticism, then you're just as hypocritical.

Nearly veryone in this thread is as wrong as the person they are arguing with for the same reasons. It's a bloody fun house of mirrors."

1316,"If you’re a white male,  hell yeah."
1317,They share a certain disdain for reality...
1318,Hypocrisy about what exactly?  Which party had the panty sniffers chasing Bill Clinton for 20 years and then turned around and voted for a guy who fucked a porn star while his wife was home nursing their child?
1319,"We elected an Adulterer president, how is that hypocrisy? "
1320,Oh clutch my pearls!

1324,“Please stop calling out my massive hypocrisy”
1325,"It's not a whataboutism. 

It's the crux of the argument as to why it's sexist. 

When Trump, a white male did it, you all cheered for him and talked about how great it was that he could hook up with a porn star. 

But now you have a problem with Kamala because she's a woman, she's black, and she's a Democrat.

When Trump did it we were more interested in the financial crimes and campaign finance violations associated with it as well as, admittedly, dunking on Evangelicals and so-called ""family values"" conservatives. 

We don't have any of those issues present with Harris. 

The problem as we see it, and the problem as you see it, are universes apart. 

The right wing press was so eager to forgive and excuse Donald Trump and the complaint about that is not one of whataboutism but one of inequality and prejudice. 

There's a difference. "
1326,"After trump the right wing has no ground to stand on. You’re on an island, alone."
1327,"Shmough you almost exclusively post dailywire and attempt to pass it as legit journalism, are you Ben Sharpio, yes or no? "

1337,">It's the crux of the argument as to why it's sexist.

Not that I agree with your position, but fair point. In my defense, I was only parodying how everyone shouts ""whataboutism"" to dodge accusations of hypocrisy."
1338,Lots of people are saying that Shmough works for Dailywire and is using a sockpuppet account to self-promote it. 
1339,I'd hate for you to be bored.
1340,"I'll try to dumb it down.

Republicans: your candidate sucks, she's an adulterer.

Democrats: Republicans can't call her an adulterer without being hypocritical because Republicans support Trump who is an adulterer.

But in order to point out their hypocrisy, you have to point out that Trump is an adulterer. Which implies Democrats are criticizing Republicans for supporting an adulterer.

Which means Democrats are also criticizing someone for being an adulterer, and doing so to defend a Democrat adulterer. 

Which makes Democrats saying this as much of a hypocrite as the Republicans they are criticizing.

You can swap 'Republican' with 'Democrat' and it looks the same from the other side.

It's a lose/lose game where everyone looks like a hypocrite.

you would be be served if political leadership was the primary metric."
1345,"Well, thats all the convincing I need"
1346,"I figured. You don't like being called a hypocrite. But I don't see how you can call them hypocrites in defense of an adulterer without falling into that trap. They don't get to play the morality card, but you need to establish a baseline of being on the wrong side of morality to call them out, which means you are playing the morality card. And you are doing it to defend and support an adulterer, which is exactly what you are accusing them of doing. "
1347,"> BoTh SiEdS!!

Uh-huh."
1348,They're not there same and I never said that. I said that your argument here is hypocritical. And it is. And you know it. And that's why you're changing the argument. Trump is a disaster and people like you with arguments like yours are why he's president. Step your game up. You've done enough damage already.
1349,"I see no one here agreeing with your gibberish, but go ahead and keep thinking you're right. Whatever helps you sleep at night.

She said Fairfax guided her to the bed, where they continued kissing, and then at one point she realized she could not move her neck. She said Fairfax used his strength to force her to perform oral sex.

1396,You are probably right whether he is there or not. It doesn't take much to keep democrats from voting or supporting democratic policies.

1398,Doesn't look over from here. But I'm sure the antidemocracy forces will continue.

It's one thing to evolve. It's another to do so because you want a job and that's the way the wind is swaying. "
1425,"I prefer politicians that don't change until after it popular with the public opinion, we need someone that fight for what's right even when it's not the cool thing. Bernie 2020 is coming and Harris doesn't have a chance no matter how much money the DNC and CNN throw at her.

"
1426,"I can't imagine I'm about to be this pedantic...  

Charlemagne asked ""there's a rumor you're against legalization"" and Harris responded ""not true"".  That indicates nothing about how she addresses her past position, but rather her current position.  Even the article admits it:
> If you listen carefully, the two of them are circumspect about how they're approaching this. They are talking about Harris' current position on marijuana legalization. She states very clearly that she is in favor of legalizing marijuana."

1430,"Okay, okay fair enough on legalization. "
1431,"She was adamantly against something for 10 years straight, then suddenly supports it when she needs to to win the primary.

Imagine if Trump, after spending the whole campaign shouting ""build the wall"", decided he wants open borders instead?"
1436,"The issue is you *can’t* be sure. She very well could pull a Trump and flip on all the things she says she wants to do/doesn’t want to do. 

You’re right in stating she was against legal weed for a while and that is something to be thoughtful about when she announces that she’s for it now, but you also  gotta understand that people definitely can change their positions on things. 

Shit, she could even personally think marijuana should stay illegal, but if she comes out and says that her constituents want it legal therefore she will legalize it, that’s totally fine as well. The whole point of being a representative is doing what the people you’re representing want done. "
1437,"> they'll be behind the curve when new challenges emerge. 

It might be more profitable to be concerned about those who don’t change for the better, but you can worry about anything that delights you."
1438,"> If people still believed in the reefer madness  

Which they don't because it's debunked.  So as science advances and gives more information on a substance like marijuana, Harris has become supportive of the push to legalize it.  There's nothing nefarious here.  Adapting positions shows open mindedness and a willingness to update one's views based on observable reality."
1439,"No one needed science in the last 15-20 years to know weed wasn't any more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco, she knew it! Hell California legalized medical weed 20 years ago. She isn't fooling anyone."
1440,"After the past several years, it's sad that it feels STRANGE to finally have leadership that actually puts principles over party(/cult?) loyalty...and doesn't just choose to dodge responsibility behind: ""Huh? Who said what? Oh...I-I...didn't hear anything about that.""

But we just TOLD you what was said, and are asking for your response...

EDIT:

To clarify, note that I didn't take any position on who was in the right or wrong regarding this particular headline.  So many political topics have such a wide range of complexity that people can be a little in the right AND a little in the wrong at the same time--even if the ""little wrong"" is as subtle as vague wording subject to misinterpretation (perhaps like my original post?).

Engaging in dialogue and acknowledging the nuance within those gray areas are a function of a healthy democracy.  (*But since this particular ""non-issue"" doesn't even rank on any list of legitimate priorities, I'm not going to waste any time on further dissection of it).*

My main point was just that it's DIFFERENT having someone with principles (*whether you agree with them or not*) in a leadership position rather than a spineless cultist who didn't stand for anything (other than achieving his top priority of massively increasing deficits)."
1441,"What principals, exactly?  Calling another party member an anti-semite after she calls out politicians for being overly influenced by the country's largest and most effective foreign policy lobby (AIPAC)?  I don't care much for those principals..."
1442,"He literally went ahead and shot himself in his other foot:

>""It's a private hospital. The funny thing is, people had an agenda that wanted to attack me said, 'Oh, you're going to choose socialized medicine.' I'm actually choosing capitalistic medicine because they only take cash from foreigners.""

So, not only should Americans not get socialized medicine, but we should embrace the free market of traveling to nations that do, so we can engage in Capitalism and pay for procedure out-of-pocket.

""Yeah, I totally defunded the fire department in our town, so they suck, but when my house caught on fire and I paid the next town over to come put out the fire, that was awesome and everybody should do like me!"" "

Despite the fact that their predictions never come true.  Not in America, where they assured us that Medicare would mean the end of private medicine, and not in other countries, like Canada, who has both a public health Care system and a private one.

It's almost as if liars always lie..."
1445,"> I'm actually choosing capitalistic medicine because they only take cash from foreigners.""

Paul lies. They take cash from out-of-province patients, but only need to if the cost is above the patient's provincial plan coverage. 

>In Canada, medical care is publicly funded and universally provided through the country's Provincial Ministry of Health

Shit reporting. There  is no national ""Provincial Ministry of Health"". Also, health care is provided by health care providers, not the government.

> It receives funding from the Ontario government and accepts the Ontario’s Hospital Insurance Plan.

More shit reporting. Ontario has the *Ontario Health Insurance Plan* (OHIP)."
1446,">""We have some centers like this,"" Paul said. ""Oklahoma has a center like this but doesn't specialize in the surgery I need. I chose (Shouldice) because they are good at it and actually the price is right.""

The price is ""right"" because even a grandfathered, private hospital in Canada is heavily subsided by the government of Ontario and is bound by the kind of regulations that control costs and prevent them from driving up the costs for your rich ass.

You are choosing a Canadian hospital because socialized medicine **doesn't** stifle achievement or innovation and **does** control costs, for everyone, even out-province assholes like you who are paying out of pocket.

You are not paying ""what the market"" determined. You're paying what the Government of Ontario, in collaboration with medical professionals, has determined covers the costs of the care, with a rather small, government controlled, profit margin.

Enjoy your excellent, world-renowned, socialized health care Paul. I'm sure you'll be treated well and they'll be glad to see you go away healthy."

1458,"They can't.

They are a Canadian hospital. By law, they can't. Even as a ""private hospital"" they can't do that. Not even to stick it to a Libertarian asshole like Paul. He is still protected by Canadian law from the very cruelties he would foist on his fellow Americans.

As Democrats and as Americans, the entire Congress must be fully engaged in denouncing and rejecting all forms of hatred, racism, prejudice and discrimination wherever they are encountered.”

 In Canada there's no legal restrictions. But, to the best of my knowledge, there's never been a case in which a baby has been 'executed after birth'. Because no pregnant woman, no OB/GYN or nurse goes into a delivery room to murder a newborn.  If things don't go well, it's devastating for all. There are laws and strict guidelines doctors must follow. Everyone would definitely 'mind' babies being murdered. Especially as it's funded by taxpayers. The things this man says are just astounding. Surely, no one thinks there'll be a stampede of pregnant women choosing to abort in the delivery room and doctors that would go along with that. That's absurd. "

Investment in tuition free colleges are just as the two others – very likely to pay for itself. Higher educated people earn more, are more law abiding, less sick and thus pay way more taxes to make up the cost.

1821,"I think the more urgent issues are the 30 week on-demand abortions, with nothing threatening the physical health of the mother."
1822,Ok
1823,"There are no '30 week on-demand abortions'.  In order to receive a late term abortion, the life of the woman or the fetus must be in jeopardy.   The woman must then obtain at least 2 separate physician referrals (depends on the state, some require more than 2).  The procedure can only take place in a hospital, with the woman usually staying overnight.

There are a myriad of reasons a woman might make this choice,  each absolutely heartwrenching.   No woman is skipping to the hospital for her abortion, despite what youve been told.  Imagine finding out at 30 weeks your babys brain didnt develop.  Your body keeps the fetus protected and alive, but once delivered,  it will suffer nothing but pain and only with the assistance of many machines.  Death would be within hours.  You love this baby, youve named it, heard the heartbeat, felt it move...  Because you love it, you decide to end its suffering now, while its still protected.  Then imagine having to labor and actually deliver your deceased child.

As a nurse, ive handled c/sections, vaginal deliveries,  adoptions, abortions, still births, children giving birth...  No woman on the planet arrives at the decision to adopt or abort lightly.  Its excruciating for them and they live with the consequences forever. Until youve been forced to make a decision like this, you should keep your opinions to yourself."
1824,">There are no '30 week on-demand abortions'. In order to receive a late term abortion, the life of the woman or the fetus must be in jeopardy.

No. You're wrong. The story below was just posted this morning on CNN, and it documents a 30 week abortion of a perfectly physically healthy mother and fetus provided by a New Mexico clinic for ""mental health"" reasons.

>She was 19 and living with a host family in Florida when she learned that she was pregnant.""Katherine,"" not her real name, was in the United States on a student visa. She's from Honduras, which has a total ban on abortion, and got pregnant over the summer while visiting home.She was confused, though. The older man she'd dated in Honduras bought a Plan B pill on the black market, she said, and told her to take it. She didn't know what it was or how it worked. When she didn't get her period, she assumed that her hormones were just out of whack because of that strange pill.After a few months back in the United States, though, her body felt and looked different. The home pregnancy test she bought at Walmart was positive, but she clung to the movie plotlines she'd seen where tests came back with false results.

She begged the clinic in New Mexico to still take her.A third-trimester abortion provider in New Mexico, who didn't want to be named and couldn't speak directly to Katherine's case, offered this to explain why someone like her would be accepted for the procedure.""My patients of all gestational ages share this commonality: Whatever their story, they have come to the decision that an abortion is absolutely necessary to preserve their mental or physical health and/or to save their unborn child from a life of suffering,"" the physician wrote in an email.Katherine was in a nervous haze the day she walked in the clinic doors. She didn't recall the injection that stopped the fetal heartbeat. She also couldn't name the medication she was given, but she definitely remembered the cramping that seized her body later at the hotel. Only after the fact did she realize that she'd gone into labor.""I was in pain you can't imagine. I wanted to die,"" she said. ""With that pain, I really was regretting having an abortion.""But that regret was short-lived. Two days later, when she ""gave birth to a dead fetus"" at the clinic, she said, she was overcome with tears of relief."
1825,"Hello fellow healthcare provider. I'm no obgyn, just a simple jock who cuts into people's limbs. But as it stands, the bill in ny and Virginia changed the ruling from endangerment of the mother's phyicial health and more than one physician OKing the procedure to only one physician giving the ok AND now included is the endangerment of the mothers mental health. So here's the issue: while most doctors would still perform the procedure responsibly, the problem is those who don't. As I see, with the new bills, a si gle doc can see a mother who can say, having this baby will affect my mental haalth because I can't afford it and it'll give me anxiety. I've changed my mind, let's get rid of it. Now a shady doc could say sure, this counts as endangerment of mental health, let's abort and I don't need to consult with my peers. That's the issue. And I'd you think it won't happen, just look at medical marijuana. So many docs prescribed it for ""legit"" reasons.

Notice how the only criticism against him right now is a meaningless issue on tax returns that aren't needed for a another year.  

The other fun criticism is that he travels on planes and the green new deal is against all planes.  Which just shows how stupid republicans are.

I'm guessing because any candidate that does release their returns will have it gone over with a fine-tooth comb by their opponents, looking for exploitable dirt to use during campaigns.  So nobody wants to be the first to release their returns (and subsequently get attacked for them).  At least that's the impression I'm getting."

The Democrats should be able to fully embrace the idea that are giving up on that kind of thing.  Winning within the confines of the law is all that matters.  If it's not illegal, it's fair game.

1972,Were you not around during the last primaries? They were super fucking hypocritical all the time.
1973,"So, you are completely clueless about that Burlington College scandal then. Let me fill you in:

1. Jane Sanders convinced the board to take out a multimillion dollar loan to acquire land to expand Burlington College. The board agreed and the loans were granted based on lies that Sanders told about supposed donations that never happened. Some of the donations turned out to be willed donations and couldn't be used until the person died. Others were just out and out bullshit, with donors testifying they never agreed to donate money for the land purchase
2. As a result of her lies, Burlington College was unable to meet its obligations on the loan and was forced to close its doors, throwing the nearly 200 students out the door without a college diploma, donors lost millions, and alumni lost their alma mater.
3. Sanders was fired for gross mismanagement, and yet for some reason was given a $200k severance package.
4. Sanders was investigated by the FBI and the Grand Jury from 2017 to early 18. While guilty of gross negligence and mismanagement, no CRIMINAL charges could be brought and the case finally closed.
5. The tax returns from that period might show money flowing from the land owners who got such a sweetheart deal and millions in compensation. Knowing what I know about how  politicians and wives of politicians act, I need some assurances that none of that land deal money made its way back into the Sanders pocket.
6. Why has he been so reluctant to release them?"
1974,Yikes.
1975,"That’s good to hear. Going back to Sanders; I like Bernie, but he needs to be more transparent. "
1976,"I actually was not, lol. "

Wow! It sounds like we shouldn't vote for Jane Sanders!"
1978,"It was bad. There people front page links here from RT and Breitbart posted in Sanders' defense daily.

It's gonna get real bad this time, now that there are candidates who actually need to put in effort to beat him. He didn't actually face any real attacks last time, since Clinton wanted to be nice and didn't need to attack him, and Trump and the GOP were super happy to argue in his defense to divide the left.

2028,I'm not a fan of it either but I will at least read the article and make a comment about its content instead of immediately down voting the post and attacking the source. I've seen a typically conservative source with an article supporting a liberal viewpoint and a liberal source supporting a conservative viewpoint. What's weird is that the conservative source gets down voted despite the content and the liberal source gets up voted despite the content. This tells me one thing. People are not reading the articles.

Yes, Trumps are traitors.  No, not everything they do is worth covering."
2050,It's a sideshow and you know it.
2051,"The Trump Family's treason is not a ""sideshow.""

The Trump Family is a traitorous disgrace to the United States.

If Trump's underclass of voters are remembered at all, they will be (rightly) remembered as ""useful idiot"" anti-Americans who backed Putin and his plans to shatter the United States and NATO.

Trump's right-wing traitors, like Putin's NRA, will be regarded as the 21st century version of the 19th century's ""Know Nothing"" party.

It's really best that Trump's fanclub of poorly-educated, low-income conspiracy freaks learn to deal with the real world.

But the Red Taker states and their Republican voters won't learn, of course.

As always, they'll just beg the Blue States for money to get them out of the stupid trouble they voted us all into (as usual.)

"
2052,"But this story is about them doing something tacky, not treasonous "
2053,No thanks. The Senate is rigged to favor small states and with a natural disadvantage it makes no sense to get rid of the minority’s only procedural roadblock.
2054,"The Filibuster exists for a reason, however it should be used as it was intended. A threat of a filibuster should not be enough to stop a vote. Make the member of Congress read the phone book etc. Make people give up their time in support of the filibuster."
2055,"
> Indeed, as Brian Beutler points out, the unwillingness to come out flatly against the filibuster suggests a more systemic refusal to embrace a full commitment to **popular democracy** at a time when Republicans are using the anti-democratic aspects of our system to the absolute maximum to gain and hold onto power


Each state regardless of population is given the same amount of senators, It’s not inherently an example of popular democracy. 



"
2056,"Nope. Until we get popular weighted representation, or hell, even tax revenue weighted representation since GOP likes valuing dollars as speech, then I am fine with the filibuster..."

2058,Very strange seeing this sub defend the filibuster. 
2059,"""Trust democracy"".  Lol. Yeah, that's what Democrats don't trust.... democracy."
2060,Why would anyone trust democracy in America? Especially in the senate where a few small states Trump the will of the people. And the 2020 presidential race is bound to become the most manipulated election in American history. 
2061,"Either the undemocratic filibuster needs to go, or dems at the very least need to make DC and Puerto Rico states and get those 3-4 senators.  The filibuster greatly, greatly favors the GOP and literally only exists to block actual governance from the majority party.  

With the filibuster in place, this country will never, *ever* see any action on healthcare, climate change, gun control, or anything else.  No wonder this country gets worse and worse every year."
2062,you cant fix the system without killing the filibuster lol
2063,Not at all. Right now it is the only thing holding back the tyranny of the minority representation...
2064,they (dems) have spent their whole lives on the defense from republicans.  they dont even know what its like to be on the offensive.  they still believe politics is just some handshakes and deal making where people come together to 'get things done' whatever that means.  they actually believe republicans govern for the common good and they will see the light.  i wonder how many times the repubs will have to spit in their faces for them to realize that?
2065,"America has never been a ""pure"" democracy so why start now?

On the other hand going with just the popular vote for president might be a better place to begin.  The electoral college is one of the lesser anti-democracy elements."
2066,"The tyranny of the minority is already here. The filibuster hasn’t stopped this administration from putting children in cages, openly violating the law, declaring the press to be public enemies, attempting to send nuclear information to the Saudis, subverting congress in order to build a wall, ban transgender people  from the military, and attempt to dismantle affordable health care. 


The only thing the filibuster would do is keep a future democratic president from being able to pass more than one substantive bill per term. "
2067,"Well said, I agree."
2068,"When we fix electoral fraud and voter disenfranchisement, then sure, let's talk about the filibuster.

Anyone else just latched onto one or two issues they like what the GOP says on it, making them foolish one issue people.

The following was posted by another contributor. I held on to the meat of it for future reference and comparison(s).

Trump has never had any business or personal dealings with the Russian mafia, with some exceptions?...

• Semion Mogilevich. He is considered a strategic threat to national security. He traffics in weapons of mass destruction, nuclear materials, drugs, prostitutes, precious gems, and stolen art.

• Vyacheslav “Yaponchik” Ivankov. He was Mogilevich’s lieutenant and resident of Trump Tower and Trump Taj Mahal. The FBI called him the ""most dangerous Mobster in America"" during a May 15, 1996 congressional hearing. He was gunned down by a sniper on a Moscow street after publicly discussing Mogilevich’s close ties to Putin.

• David Bogatin and Michael Markowitz. Identified by U.S. officials as a member of the Semion Mogilevich organized crime family in the 1990s. They owned five condos in Trump Tower.

• Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov Russian Mobster boss who had been a fugitive after James Comey indicted him for fixing figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was eventually found running a global gambling ring one floor below Trump's penthouse apartment. He escaped a second time only to be turn up 3 months later in Moscow as a VIP attendee for Donald Trump's Miss Universe 2013. Guess who was the federal prosecutor who busted up the global gambling ring? Preet Bharara

• Helly Nahmad. bought all the units on the 51st floor for more than $18.4 million. He went to prison for about five months in 2014 for leading a high-stakes gambling network.

• Vadim Trincher. Ran a connected ring for Russian oligarchs and high stakes gambling network. He “laundered approximately $100 million in proceeds from their gambling operation in Russia and Ukraine through shell companies and bank accounts in Cyprus.”

• Viktor Vekselberg. Former KGB and oligarch who was the second largest shareholder in the Bank of Cyprus. Current Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, was Vice President of Bank of Cyprus.

• Oleg Deripaska. His ties go beyond the $10 million dollars he paid Paul Manafort?. He's been trying to form connections with powerful Republicans for many years Between 2003-2005, Deripaska paid $560,000 to Bob Dole's lobbying firm for assistance in obtaining a US Visa. During the 2008 Presidential Election, Paul Manafort and Rick Davis (Trump's foreign policy advisor) introduced Oleg to John McCain with hopes of forming a strong relationship.

• Rinat Akhmetov. Richest person in Ukraine who is suspected leader of Ukraine Mafia. Personally hired and paid Paul Manafort in 2005 to be advisor for Viktor Yanukovych election campaign.

• Dmytro Firtash. Pro-Russian Ukrainian billionaire who is one of Paul Manafort’s biggest clients. By his own admission, he maintains strong ties with a recurring figure on this scene, the reputed Ukrainian/Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich.

• Roy Cohn. He was Trump's long time lawyer, friend, and go-to lawyer for the mob. Some of his clients included the Genovese Family, Gambino Family, and the Red Mafiya. Sometime in the 1980's Roy Cohn introduced Paul Manafort and Roger Stone to Donald Trump.

• Michael Cohen. He has been working for The Trump Organization since 2007 and is a member of the Trump World Tower Condominium Board and the Trump Park Avenue Condominium Board. He also has been a confidant of the Russian organized criminality since at least 1999 and has been laundering money for Russian citizens having connections with the Russian mafia.

• Ivana Trump. Ivana Trump went into business with two known Russian mobsters, Boris and Michael Vax.

2158,Oh god no!
2159,"No, it was the day he was elected, he didn't want to actually be president."
2160,"It was widely reported his father took him to task over all this and basically told him, I didnt survive the Holocaust to have Trump destroy our family name. Any son would look pretty sad and humbled by that. "

No it wouldn't because the crimes ARE happening in other states. Why would Indiana see a higher crime rate when all their guns are  going to Chicago? Why would you expect a higher crime rate in the state of origin over the state of destination. Same thing happened between DC and Virginia, and New York and other states.

2234,I know you were. Background checks are already required for gun sales. This extends the checks to cover temporary transfer. Criminals cannot legally buy guns right now. This bill changes nothing regarding criminals obtaining guns. It tries to tell them that a criminal handing their gun to a criminal friend even without a sale requires a background check that neither can pass. My second sentence was a bit of sarcasm to highlight that it is pointless because criminals are going to ignore this law. I guess my mistake was assuming people had read the article to see what the bill actually does and understood it. I can see now that I was likely wrong about one or both of those.

> As the chart shows, it usually takes an economic recession to cause year-over-year job losses at NYC&#039;s full-service restaurants, so it&#039;s likely that this is a &quot;Restaurant recession&quot; tied to the annual series of minimum wage hikes that brought the city&#039;s minimum wage to $15 an hour at the end of last year.

I agree with you that living wage should be built in and tips not standard.  Some wait staff will hate that.

I do think tax structure needs some changes, but no one is entitled to cheat the system/their fellow taxpayers.

Some of the more disturbing practices happen from the business end, too. The way tips are distributed some places.  The tricking people into thinking delivery fees (or some tip jars) are for delivery people/servers when they aren't.  And, of course, general wage theft, which is illegal, but happens too often."

We were treated like whiney, slacker teens through our thirties until the Mellenials began to go away to college. Now they take the brunt of that particular form of belittlement from the Boomers.

I'm sick of the Hippie generation thinking they know what the kids are all on about and treating the concerns of young adults like they're some kind of teen angst.

They've been doing it for two generations now.

EDIT: And Millenials aren't even *young* adults anymore! That's the Parkland kids! *They're* the young adults of today. Mellenials are pushing forty, and Gen Xers like me are upwards of fifty easily. But the Boomers can't get their heads around it. "

2500,"Yeah I have seen him speak several times recently and he said the same on Colbert.  

Saying you have more experience than the current POTUS is pointless.  I have socks that I wore to ""World at War"" class with more political experience than Trump.  

He may have more *years* (2) of executive experience than Pence, but being Governor and being the mayor of South Bend are different worlds. I'd take 4 years of experience as Governor over 6 as mayor of South Bend 10 times out of 10.  I think he should lose that argument tbh. It's like saying a guy who worked 6 years at McDonald's has more experience in a kitchen than someone who spent 4 in a Michelin starred restaurant.  Technically it's true - but it's nonsense. It's not like he has 15 more years than Pence.  It's only 2 more years in a MUCH lower position. And being the Executive of South Bend doesn't exactly translate/isn't comparable to being POTUS.  He governs 100k people. The POTUS governs *3300x* more people.  Experience isn't his strength. His service, intellect, empathy and youth are his strengths.  

The wartime experience (and being a Rhodes Scholar) are what I like most about him - so no issues there.  I think he should focus more on that than his experience as Mayor.  We want someone who knows the peril of war and won't treat our armed services like political footballs.  I would also like someone whose intelligence is apparent when they speak.  And he's a great speaker.  

I like the guy - **a lot** - so I hope it doesn't sound like I'm taking cheap shots.  I think the issues I have with him are fair and will be shared by millions.  

If you want to be taken seriously for the Presidency then you have to be elected to a higher office first and prove you can succeed there.  Which I believe he can and will do.  He has everything it takes to lead our country - but right now ""electability"" is everything and he lacks it.  An unknown Mayor of a small college city is not going to get it done against Trump.  We need to pull out the big guns this cycle and can't leave anything to chance.  

I wouldn't blame anyone for voting for him in the primary because I think his future is SUPER bright, but now's not the time. Imo anyway.

Some may not be as progressive as leftists would like, some may be more left than centrists would like. Progressive and pragmatist aren't mutually exclusive.

Also, in the line you quoted, he said he makes decisions that *may look* leftist or centrist, he didn't claim to be both."
2509,"The “adults” that frequent this subreddit can’t even understand something as complexed and nuanced as “vote based on quality, not opinion” so I’m definitely not buying that one."
2510,"Everyone falls somewhere on the ideological spectrum. Taking someone’s statement that their politics is “pragmatism” at face value is like taking Rand Paul at his word when he says he only believes in liberty. If we’re going to be serious about this we should view pragmatism, when used as a description of one’s political position, as a synonym of centrism, because it is obviously more practical to position yourself in the middle of things."

So sick and tired of this trope that Venezuela is in trouble because it's socialist. Why aren't Canada, Finland, or so many other countries in such dire shape? Because they're not run by corrupt dictators. 

Socialism doesn't destroy these countries, fucking DICTATORS do. Venezuela failed because the dictator:

1. Led to a massive brain drain in various industries/areas
2. Seized companies and handed them over to goons/friends who ran them into the ground
3. Engaged in systematic corruption from top to bottom, all levels of the government.

Even if you look at a US-centric, jobs-focused lists like the one put out by New Engineer (https://newengineer.com/insight/the-10-best-cities-for-civil-engineering-1136451), they can only drum up two spots for us: the number one spot for NYC, which is interesting considering the mess that is the subway system, and Texas, based largely on a high-speed rail system -- the type of system that Americans, apparently, do not want and think is a boondoggle.

If you look at an economics-focused list, like the World Bank (https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&order=LPI%20Rank#datatable), we're 14th. Right above...New Zealand. A country 37 times smaller.

It is plain on its face for anyone who has traveled abroad (or, for that matter, for those that have visited some feats of incredible American engineering that could never be undertaken today - the Hoover Dam, etc) that we're simply not as good at it as we think. 

The reasons are numerous, but even in my small little life, I've seen some of the things that have made this the case. I went to one of the top engineering schools in the US (not as an engineering student myself). I had two friends in college who started in civil engineering. Both, because of their desire to be highly employable ($100k plus bonus) fresh out of college, changed their majors - one to EE, one to CE. After graduating, both ended up getting their desired highly paid jobs - with military contractors."
2575,"Well-put on all counts.  

That New Engineer ranking for Texas is highly amusing to me.  I'm from Houston, where our congressmen (especially John Culberson - who was recently finally ousted) often oppose light rail through their districts in town, despite Houston being a nightmare of urban sprawl and traffic that's been begging for light rail for decades now.  So to see a technical journalist rank Texas in the top 10 for the potential jobs effect of a planned ""bullet train"" between Houston and Dallas is highly amusing."

&#x200B;

That is why moderates are branded GOP-light, because the GOP structures their whole political structure around pleasing their voters while not mentioning a single inkling of actual policy other than platitudes. And instead of talking about the issues or actual policies you take offense too or clash with your beliefs, you attack the platitudes of parties or individuals within them and disassociate outright with someone that shares a majority of your ideals because its not all ""for you"".

&#x200B;

The thing about politics and political parties is that they have to work for everyone, it's a discussion and debate, a clash of ideals. If you dismiss someone wholesale because they disagree with you on single issues or because of something so innocuous as a literal ""no true scotsman"" argument you have no place to complain about not having outreach bend over backwards for you."

Oh lord. I'm going to try to break this down for you. 

They do have exactly that. Some states allow independents to run. Some states have caucuses. Some states have closed primaries. All those things involve a bunch of *rules* about how and which people can vote. Iowa, a state I mentioned in my earlier response has closed caucuses. The entire number of votes cast in that state was about 1500. Total votes.

Hillary had about 150,000 more votes than Bernie in *Louisiana*. You're pretending that the totals mean anything but when they set it up so situations like that actually exist *they obviously don't*.

Probably longer than you. A reminder though lad: attack the argument not the person.

>How many Democrats are fighting against universal health care and a living wage?

How many are fighting for it? How many of them even used the words ""minimum wage"" while Obama was in office? The great centrist hopes this year like Klobuchar are specifically running on the ""we can't do any of that"" platform. Sherrod Brown's fighting for Medicare for old. Other democrats insist on talking about universal *coverage* instead of universal healthcare. The people who have *coverage* now can't afford to use it.

It was entirely Trump who acted belligerent and ripped up the deal. If he had an incidence of non-compliance, he could have railed against it on those grounds, but he didn't. Instead he pretty much only had the notion that because Obama had authorized the deal, it must have been bad, so we got to lose a great deal of international credibility in order to sate his desire to rip up anything Obama had a part in accomplishing.

That's not good enough. The great deal maker has failed to replace it with anything of value.

I don't have to support a man who views the North Korean conflict as a photo op. Especially when it was his Twitter rhetoric that riled them up in the first place.

The fact that he views himself as the only man capable of solving international conflicts like this undermines his attempt in the first place. He's utterly unprepared, and totally capable of bringing us to a worse position than when we started.

Remember, the last time he had a conversation with North Korea, he fired his Secretary of State just prior to the talks. He then flew into the meeting point to talk privately for all of a day, snap some pictures, and then fly out. He managed to secure not even so much as an agreement on when to meet again, nevermind any sort of peace framework.

The combination of his complete lack of concern for details and his insistence that he alone can solve an international crisis by talking to foreign leaders one on one with no public record of what's being said or even the security of an additional party to keep both sides honest is bound for failure. We're better off not meeting at all, because it's just going to be another photo op at best."

3360,"I care less about how opposed the DemSocs are to intervention in Venezuela than I do their lack of willingness to call out authoritarianism when you see it.

Acknowledging how dictatorial Maduro is does not obligate you to advocate imperialist intervention. High-profile DemSocs seem to think it does—or at least that speaking honesty will give the government the power to go ahead with intervention. So they rhetorically soften Maduro’s anti-democracy.

I think DemSocs know you can argue for non-intervention even while being forthright about Maduro. They just lack the courage of that conviction, or the confidence that people will follow the argument.

I still believe that DemSocs can move the country in a positive direction, if they discard this knee-jerk reaction in support of American imperialism’s enemies. The DemSocs can realize that the enemy of their enemy is not necessarily their obligatory friend. The larger point of this editorial is garbage."
3361,"What if they can't? The US managed a revolution because it was the 1770s. People didn't have cars. They had horses. A musket took a long time to load and super innacurate.

Venezuela has a modern military. Sure, maybe not the BEST military, but one that owns jets, tanks, machine guns, sniper rifles, missles, mortars.

You think the North Koreans all just love the Kim dynasty? No. It's because a rebellion would get squashed instantly. They would just murder everyone. Or take their children by force. Put them in work camps. Torture them while you watch.

Should we do nothing if Maduro refuses to cede power when his citizens demand it? Things are going to get violent if there isn't an intervention. I hope it doesn't have to be a military one, but if Maduro isn't going to cede power, force is going to be his only option to deal with the populace.

Should we never intervene? Must there be violence? Genocide? Should we try to stop the fall of a democracy at its onset? Or do we wait until a dictator solidifies power?

How many actual Venezuelans are ""asking"" for help? Would the country be so enthusiastic about intervention if Venezuela had NO OIL? We must learn *something* from our military adventurism in Afghanistan and Iraq, two countries that are WORSE OFF than when we invaded. And yes, Saddam Hussein in power would be a better outcome for Iraq than the death and destruction we have wrought there. The most we should do is pressure them diplomatically to hold new elections anything else is unacceptable. "

There *is*, however, a long history of American intervention in South America, and all of it has made the people of the region worse off. 

I find it rich that you think America should intervene in Venezuala to save democracy after a century of overthrowing democratically elected governments. You are balls deep in ideology. Let’s also not forget that sanctions aren’t good for the people of Venezuela either or its economy, i NEVER see that mentioned by liberals. 

American intervention would **not**  result in a better democracy for the country. You may not know this, but Venezuelans support the seizure of Land owned by American companies because those companies have done nothing but perpetuate a century long cycle of manipulation, oppression, and environmental destruction. American intervention will only exacerbate that cycle. "

What would have to happen in Venezuela before it was a good idea? What if you could ask every citizen and 75% said the US should help them?"
3374,"Yes, you didn’t say that and i’m sorry. 

I don’t know what it would take. That statistic isn’t the case and for good reason (i know you were speaking hypothetically). I don’t believe in foreign entities influencing the elections of other nations, nor do i think that America could ever intervene in a way that acted as a net positive for the people of Venezuala. There’s just**so much**  history to contradict it"
3375,"No worries. You're obviously very passionate in your beliefs.

I generally think we should stay the fuck out too. We're bad news bears a lot of the time. However, you must have metrics to make such a decision. Past mistakes of America don't count in this situation. That was then, this is now. Is there no danger to the people of Venezuela from Maduro? Is there no cost to doing nothing?

Hopefully there's no war. But military threat could at least get Maduro's attention. Allow for diplomacy. The man won't let aid in. I think he may not have his people's best interest at heart."
3376,"Maduro is a vicious man. Many Venezuelans legitimately believe in his platform, but not his heavy handed approach towards stifling democracy. A lot of the protestors are just as left as he is. Maduro should not be trusted. But he also should not be overthrown. 

I think the past matters because every single time something like this was tried, it always ended the same. Why is this time any different? And despite Maduro’s flagrant abuse of human rights, there is also a ton of disinformation and propaganda perpetuated by the US government. I would claim that the cost of doing something would be higher than the cost of doing nothing. "
3377,">I think the past matters because every single time something like this was tried, it always ended the same.

Could you parse that out a bit? Every time what was tried it ended how? It's very hard to make sweeping generalizations, especially since mich of our previous conflicts happend during the Cold War, a specific time in history.

Besides, more than 50 countries have issued statements essentially calling Maduro an illigitimate leader. If the US isn't involved militarily, but other countries are, does it change things? The US definitely shouldn't be leading a military effort, given past experiences, but pretty much the whole western hemisphere has said Maduro should go. 

If he doesn't go and just shrugs at diplomacy, do we just let what was one of the richest countries in South America descend into chaos and dictatorship? "

Oh, there wasn’t any election in Saudi Arabia. Oh, women are treated as third class citizens. So I find it interesting that Trump is kind of selective as to where he is concerned about democracy.

This is the worst whataboutism that you can come out to defend your position on refusing to call Maduro a dictator.

Saudi Arabia, despite being a monarchy and very backwards, it's their culture and religion.

Venezuela, on the other hand, used to be the most progressive and most prosperous country in the region and now it's the poorer and backwards in the hemisphere, thanks to Chávez and Maduro. I think you must call out both dictatorships in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, but the way you must work them out of their backwardness is different.

Just about the time all of those unwanted pregnancies that would have resulted in unwanted children that would have been coming out of their teens and old enough to be committing crimes.

So the title is correct. "
3448,No Dems love killing babies that survived abortion. The bill says babies who survives abortion should get medical treatment. It has nothing to do with protecting a baby inside a womb.

This was done in 1962, prior to the moon landing, [without a reflector](https://www.nature.com/articles/1941267a0).  Bouncing a laser off the moon proves nothing other than it can be done;  a neat trick, but nothing which requires a physical reflector to be present

>Let me ask you, do you know any reputable scientists who believe the landing was a hoax?

Not sure, and it wouldn't matter, honestly.  Just because none have risked their careers debunking it does not directly imply they believe it to be true.

I don't think this is the real allegation, here. The allegation is that the media (CNN in this case) is misleading *you*, the viewer on several fronts. Further, that misleading is done intentionally, and with an agenda towards a specific outcome (one that I might call 'reinforcing the neoliberal capitalist status quo' or something along those lines). 

Nobody is alleging that there is some sinister plot against Bernie Sanders specifically. They are alleging that some sinister plot (though, I think 'plot' suggests a more conscious behavior than is actually happening.

>No, CNN didn't disclose, and that was bad. But enough with the persecution complex. Not everything is a sinister plot to destroy Bernie, and the fact that any criticism at all is seen as an unforgivable attack is not how you win voters to your side.

That wasn't a response to anyone but just a comment on the article. You acknowledge the concern raised by progressives - cnn is not acting impartial. You then use gross hyperbole to accuse, I'm assuming progressives at large as you addressed no one specific, of being victims of a persecution complex etc. You're attributing a particular negative attitude to a wide group of people in the party who have made a valid criticism.

It isn't impossible. Are you familiar with the concept of a straw man? Because you're literally making one. The issue isn't the question that was asked (though  why it isn't asked nearly as frequently of other politicians whose campaigns have those issues is beyond me) but it was that the network was dishonest about the context it provided. Knowing that person x with a hostile question is employed by a lobbying firm is important context that was withheld. You just acknowledged that above.

>Why must it be part of an intricate conspiracy to destroy him?

Hmm. Again - you're the one making this argument in this thread. All that I've seen progressives make of this is one of a number of examples of exactly this sort of bad behaviour by CNN. It's true that brazille leaked debate questions to Clinton before the 2016 debate. It's true that Sanders town hall was aired at a time when the west coast was just leaving their desks. Its true that they provided misleading context as to the identities of the participants in this town hall. Those actions all have negative effects on the Sanders campaign. That doesn't mean there's a smoke filled room full of people targetting him but it is okay to acknowledge the trend of CNN's actions. You're the one talking about grand conspiracies here and intimating that anyone daring to bring up these actions must have a 'persecution complex'.

What is wrong with educating your child on how to safely handle a firearm? Two things are 90% of firearm safety is common sense but you'd be surprised at the situational stupidity of some people. Some folk don't realize that looking down the barrel from the muzzle is a bad thing.

One Kentucky county's [**sheriff**](https://www.abc15.com/national/lock-your-doors-load-your-gun-kentucky-sheriff-warns-in-stopping-law-enforcement) literally just told the people to arm themselves because the office didn't have enough money to keep operating. The Parkland shooting could have been nullified if the Broward County sheriff and the FBI actually did their jobs. If someone wasn't so incompetent with the background checks, the Illinois shooting in Aurora wouldn't have happened. And then there are cases of outright, malicious corruption like the Gun Trace unit in Baltimore City.

I agree about never picking a gun up in the street. But the rest of your sentiment is dangerous. It is the parent that tells their kids that guns are bad and to not touch them that instills a sense of curiosity. Curious kids who don't know anything about guns other than not to touch them will ultimately find a way to touch one, whether it be at a friend's or relative's home. By giving a curios kid a chance to handle a cleared-safe weapon, instructing them on how it operates and the 4 rules, and maybe even taking them to the range so they have no other questions. Curious kids who are told not to do something usually end up trying to do it to be rebelious.

3789,"The CDC is prohibited from using government funds for advocating for gun control, which makes sense since one of their directors flat out said their goal was to get guns banned. "
3790,"Perhaps you should actually learn something about the Dickey amendment instead of simply naming it as some sort of talisman.

The Dickey amendment resulted from the CDC violating it's own charter by funding clearly biased research in order to pursue & support a political agenda. 

> One of the lead researchers employed in the CDC’s effort was quoted, stating “We’re going to systematically build the case that owning firearms causes deaths.” Another researcher said he envisioned a long-term campaign “to convince Americans that guns are, first and foremost, a public health menace.”

This is not how science works. 

The Dickey amendment does not prevent the collection of data. Nor does it prevent scientific research. The only thing is does is prevent spending federal funds to support a political agenda. 

The CDC lost 1% of its funding for about two years more than 20 years ago.  

During 1996, 1997, and 1998 (after passage of the Dickey amendment) the CDC collected data about defensive gun uses. Instead of publishing this data, they buried it. If there were a problem with data collection methods, the right thing to do would be to correct the methods and continue collecting data. They did not. The data collected by the CDC subsequent to passage of the Dickey amendment supports an estimate several hundred thousand defensive gun uses annually. Clearly, this is at odds with the CDC's previously stated political agenda.

I suppose the act of not publishing data because it does not support your agenda is somehow different from funding clearly biased research. I don't really see much difference."

Kavanaugh did the same thing with his lies about “devils triangle” and his petulant whining about how now he can never work again (both claims obviously bullshit).

Regardless, if the women testify and seem credible, like Kavanaugh’s victim, hopefully the Democrats will jump on this opportunity to show that the Democratic Party will no longer excuse credible rape allegations in order to preserve power like the GOP still does.

Political positions are not and should not be subject to the “innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” standard we hold criminal courts too.

This is the man who forcibly raped a woman in a hotel room, using his strength to hold her head while he orally raped her. That woman, a liberal progressive activist and democrat who was attending the democratic national convention, had the courage to come forward and tell her story to the Washington Post last year when Fairfax was first running for office. They responded by spiking her story and telling her to keep it quiet. He was elected. Then when Northam's abortion comments & blackface photos made it seem he might step down and Fairfax take over, she finally came forward publicly and told the story that the WaPo tried to cover up. First Fairfax denied the story entirely and said she was lying, then he changed his story and admitted to having sex with her, but now claims it was ""100% consensual"" and she was ""really into him""

4061,"This grow the pie nonsense is complete bullshit. You know how I know? 

Because ""the pie"" (GDP) has grown slower in the 40 years since we began focusing on ""growing the pie"" than in the 40 years before when taxes on the rich were higher and growth was faster through the Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations.

Believe it or not, ever increasing inequality can lead to ever *decreasing* growth. Friedman is such a dolt, that he can't or won't let himself realize that. But it's true. It's just plain true. Look at Federal Reserve data. [Economic growth was higher when there was less inequality.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Blog/2017/February/BlogImage_RealGDP_020717.jpg)

The idea that giving the rich a fatter slice of the pie is the only way to grow the pie is wrong. Maybe giving the middle class a fatter slice would help. Maybe giving the poor a fatter slice would help. Maybe the malnourished guy who doesn't get enough food feels too sick to work, but with a fatter slice, starts feeling better and being more productive.

But Friedman doesn't want to think of that. So he trashed AOC and both-siderism'd it yet again, and presented Bloomberg as a Democrat (holy shit he's not, he spent most of his career as a Republican, and he's far to the right of the center of the Democratic party). 

Fuck this guy. Can we just send him back to the 1990s so he can bullshit about McWorld and Lexuses forever?

But idk republicans have a lot of petty culture issues they wont ever get over so i see nothing changing and potentially the birth of new nations rising."
4069,"They've been trying for years (see: Obamacare) and look where that got us.  What we *really* need to do is stop assuming that republicans will ever act in good faith, and either play by the same rules they do, or actually enforce the goddamn rules and put some motherfuckers behind bars."

4075,Our democracy wasn’t designed for a number of political parties. 
4076,"IMO, our democracy needs to make some adjustments. Unfortunately, while the country is so polarized, any proposed changes would be viewed as an attack by half the population. "
4077,It wasn't designed for two parties either. It just kinda happened that way. 
4078,"The problem that I see with a third party is that it will always be seen as a spoil.  It's either ""You're taking votes away from democrats, so the republicans will win!"" or ""You're taking votes away from republicans, so the democrats will win!""

The only other option for a third party to form is to be a very centrist party that unites moderate republicans and democrats. But, a lot of moderates are still single-issue voters. Sure, they are willing to compromise on foreign policy or taxes, but not on abortion rights, gun rights or LGBTQ rights. I think this is even less likely than the first option.

&#x200B;

I do think that with both republican and democratic parties experiencing fractures, it leave the option for an additional right and left wing party to form, meaning there is no spoil because there are four combating parties. I don't think it is particularly likely right now, but I do think it is possible. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could theoretically form their own progressive party while a challenger to Trump forms their own.

Again, I don't think it is likely to happen soon. But, maybe within the next decade."
4079,"Sure, but they aren't that far apart...  and they both disagree with the extreme platforms of their parties...  the problem is that the moderate Republicans lack the courage to speak out  against Trumpism, and the moderate dems have not learned from the disaster in 2016.  So moderates of both sides are probably the smaller part of their parties, but if both side's moderates could compromise and team up, they couldn't lose."
4080,"That’s what they want you to believe. I fact, the Founding Fathers wasted no time in forming them. "
4081,"Exactly. Even if they tried to de-institutionalize the political parties in the US, you would still end up with two opposing caucuses in Congress."
4082,Moderate Republicans don't seem to exist anymore.
4083,"They warned us against them and made them, yes. but there was never a design feature that said two is best."
4084,They aren't allowed to admit it.
4085,"""Moderate Republicans"" is an oxymoron, like ""compassionate conservatism."""
4086,Well actually the design itself is what causes a two-party system. There have been third parties in the past—and they never last very long. Because the structure of a winner take all system doesn’t allow it. Who knows what they thought was best or not. 
4087,Who’s not allowing it?
4088,I guess that’s true.

lol pathetic.

I guess OP forget about when the campaign literally met with Russian reps in trump tower and then kept lying about it"
4172,Hahahahhahaha!
4173,Stop.  I need to practice my mental tumbling routine.
4174,"There was a point in our history when we were shooting each other over the right to own human beings. 

I think we’ll make it through a reality television show host president. "
4175,And the MAGA nuts waving the Rebel flag cheered as they rolled coal down the remnants of the once maintained roads.
4176,"The end of all nations would be more correct. 

 If there is to be a global power it will have to have representatives from current nations and regions.  

Globalization of government and the economy is inevitable.

No one wants to talk about it because there are some powerful individuals, all mega-billionaires who want to preserve their own personal wealth and power and will do so by aligning with like thinking national leaders to choose instead a path that means a return to constant wars for dominance. 

There are two separate goals and two very separate groups, One seeking global dominance through violent oppression of the great masses of people, consent via violent oppression and another group, who 

very reluctantly understand that the consent must be a consensus gained with recognition of individual human rights and participation in choosing the agendas and goals along with  protection for the physical environment necessary to support life. "
4177,"I mean, you'd think so"
4178,"Yeah really. This article was really dramatic. I don't like Trump or his actions, but the US isn't falling. There are still fail safes in place to prevent a dictatorship from happening. 

We've already made it past a civil war, and are much more United than we were then despite the narrative that is constantly pushed by sensationalized media. "
4179,"I dont think so . We’re still divided and as long as we are still being inefficient as an country with the constant swing of goverment control , partisan politics , taking steps forward and back, culture wars i think its likely we can reach a breaking point again. But i think liberalisim is on a constant rise and shall prevail over conservative candidates more often but  conservatives will still have a significant number and judging from alot of the conservative nuts on breitbarb coming together and finding solutions to make American life best for all doesnt seem to be on their agenda. It just seems like oil and water ."
4180,"What’s more concerning is their gerrymandering, election fraud, voter suppression and court stacking. 

It doesn’t matter how much of a center-left majority their is if they can’t vote, won’t vote or have their votes discarded."
4181,Is this an HA Goodman piece?
4182,"By getting through a primary, just like anyone else who could win."
4183,"Not be sandbagged by corporate special interest that rely on “liberal” media outlets to run non stop hitpieces while simultaneously fluffing centrist Corp Dems (Biden, Harris etc)"
4184,Here’s how Bernie can win the 2016 election 
4185,Do we really need these types of articles again?
4186,I think the article makes a good point. Bernie needs to figure out how to include more people of color while continuing to court white voters. He did a terrible job last time with black voters. 
4187,"Bernie is a fossil. He will be 79, which is 10 years older than Reagan or Trump when they took office."
4188,"Bernie paid the women on his campaign less than their male counterparts... he has a lot of explaining to do. Also women are the reason we now have some oversight... they did well in 2018. If there is not a woman on the ticket, there will be hell to pay"
4189,Bernie has a chance to win the Democrat nomination but wont have a chance in hell in the general
4190,"Yup. He’s doing a fair good job so far. This sort of article is going to be fodder for the presses for a year.

Pick the key words people are reading, add a bit of mystery to the headline, publish, repeat."
4191,How about instead if everybody does their homework on the candidates. They will see who has been on the front lines of justice and equality issues for decades. Many of the same platform ideas that only recently most of the democratic nominees have gone near. 
4192,"Bernie has said their 2020 campaign will have the highest standards to deal with treatment of women on the campaign, and that he intends to have a female VP."
4193,It's been a day.
4194,"It is a common tactic to push the myth that Bernie is out of touch with minorities, because nothing you can say in response is anything but inflammatory regardless. 

They handwave his congressional voting record and his decades of activism and nearly always trot out an out of context quote to make their position more appealing. 

Remember, people who harbor fear of a President Sanders are not ideologically bound to rational or ethical debate, and aren't amenable to have their positions changed. 

They might not literally be propaganda outlets, but their disinterest in the truth makes it so it doesn't really matter. "
4195,"That is an awesome idea and believing that is a great way to a second term for Trump. It's important for candidates to reach out, that's all I'm saying. I wish everyone was informed and voted in their own interest."
4196,They also argue the cost is pie in the sky without looking at his proposals on how to pay for it. 
4197,Why are you excited for the idea of a 2nd trump term?
4198,"Their own think tank released reports that it would be cheaper than what we are doing now and they _still_ claim it is an economic failure...

Welcome to the post-truth era. "

4205,"For what it's worth, I'm going to chime in here with general disappointment over presidential electoral politics.

Without the Tea Party and Republican House/Senate there would be no Trump. Without Republican state governments there would be far less gerrymandering and voter suppression. If everyone focused half of their political attention on their own local politics this country would be a hell of a lot better off."
4206,Misleading headline.
4207,"Sooner or later someone in the media will discover that AOC's policies were directly adapted from Bernie's. In fact, Justice Democrats is an off-shoot of Bernie's 2016 campaign. To say that she won't back Sanders for 2020 is somewhat unfair since she promotes his policies in the House. "
4208,"nothing here is equal to AOC refusing to back Bernie. i do think, though, that there are two realistic options: endorse Bernie, or endorse no one at all. i’m hoping for the former, but unfortunately thinking that the latter happens "
4209,"Huh?   Learn context.

https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-context-definition-application-quiz.html"
4210,"Even without ""super delegates,"" endorsements from big names have a similar effect. People are going to be counting up these endorsements to quantify support before any actual voter casts a vote in the primaries. Well done AOC for deciding to let the voters decide."
4211,"It's only February 2019, my dudes."
4212,This is why AOC's detractors keep failing: they are entirely unaware of how gently they lob softballs.

4217,"Gotta be his race issues. Man, when he gets hung out to dry by some younger Dem faces the Bernie Bros are gonna have a conniption."
4218,I doubt she'll endorse anyone till they announce a running mate. She won't back an all white male ticket - that would be a disaster for the base.
4219,"Is this the Dem/Dem divisive psy-op thing I've been hearing so much about? 

EDIT:  Hi Vlad!"
4220,"lol. Really? She's attached at the hip with Bernie.

https://youtu.be/RG9N4ZP5MQA?t=28


edit: In any case, AOC will endorse Sanders at some strategic point. Right before Super Tuesday probably. "
4221,How does endorsing a candidate prevent her from doing her job?
4222,Maybe she likes Warren. She is a little more savvy than a Bernie or bust type. Progressive policy takes a lot of people and she may favor another progressive. Either way are people gonna call her a traitor if she fails to endorse the Bern like Warren in 2016? Or is it more mature to let the primary play out if you know you can swing a race?
4223,The other realistic option is to allow the primary process to play out and endorse the presumptive democratic nominee.
4224,Did Bernie endorse her when she ran? I don't believe he did.
4225,"Girls don’t fart, silly."
4226,"When someone posts a comment. Then edits it to mention that they got downvoted, I’m 100% going to downvote it. Stop being a little bitch. They’re internet points. Make your case and move on. 

Edit: NOBODY BETTER DOWNVOTE ME!!"
4227,"AOC is the ultimate Bernie Bro and I’m glad to have her on our side.

She’ll endorse him eventually. Smart move for her to not jump the gun so quick"
4228,"Who she endorse matters and its still very early.

Its not like picking an icecream flavor. 

It could effect who is willing to work with her on legislation.



"
4229,"How does jumping into an endorsement less than a day after he announced his campaign do anything? Heck, we don't even know who the candidates will be for the primary yet.

Also, who gives a damn about who a House rep with one month's experience endorses?

Who are the other House freshmen endorsing? Who cares."
4230,She was one of Bernie's delegates in 2016. She's probably holding out for a strategic endorsement.
4231,"AOC was a Bernie girl before becoming a national figure, and is aligned with Justice Dems/OurRev/DSA - the first has historically been in on Bernie, the second was made specifically to create Berniecrats, and the third is also all in on Bernie but still shy about it. There's absolutely 0 reason to expect her to back someone like Warren other than anti-Bernie whimsy. 

99% chance she endorses Bernie

But no reason to rush things. Why not first stir a media frenzy about it? Or when it has some other added strategic value? The time will be ripe."
4232,"Well, if Warren had swung the general race by staying quiet in the primary, I probably would have forgiven her, but look how that turned out.  "
4233,"Interesting, had not even consider she'd ""keep her powder dry"" to throw weight around later in the race. 


Pretty savvy."
4234,agreed.
4235,You really think that someone that is willing to work with her now on legislation is going to refuse to do so simply because she endorsed Sanders? That seems pretty far fetched.
4236,The person I replied to implied that endorsing Sanders could somehow prevent her from doing her job. I simply asked how.
4237,You should probably head back to the frog meme sub or Conspiracy.
4238,"Endorsements matter. 

If they don't mean anything then why write an entire article on her avoiding the question."
4239,"I don't think you understand how Washington DC works...

Who she endorses certainly matters, say she chooses wrong? anything she wants to do will then be blocked by the new president."
4240,those idiots have a hate boner for her
4241,"Maybe she wants to wait until the Primaries or something reasonable like that.

The election is in 2020."
4242,"Sure they matter, but I still don't see how an endorsement would prevent her from doing her job. "
4243,I understand that endorsements matter...I'm just questioning the person who said that making an endorsement would affect her ability to do her job.
4244,She is not ready to endorse someone at this early point of the campaign.
4245,"it will effect her job. say Biden wins the nomination, and the presidency in 2020( pure fantasy don't think he is running). and she endorses say warren instead. Biden could very easily make any bill she creates, or co-signs stuck in committee forever. congress isn't a one man operation, and she is a freshman Representative, she has very little political power stored up to to use in this case.

If she endorses the wrong candidate it could very well lead to her not being able to do her job at all. people in washington can be very spiteful."
4246,"Well obviously, but that has nothing to do with the claim that endorsing someone would somehow prevent her from doing her job. "
4247,This is pure mental gymnastics and has no actual basis in reality.
4248,"She doesn’t want to endorse anyone yet, for now shes focused on her job.

This should not be a hard concept.

Are you sugesting she should hurry up and pick before we even have a debate?

Are you trying to say she should be trying to pick before we even known everyone who is running?

Are you really confused by any of this or are you just sturring up shit?"
4249,Then you have no experience in Washington politics...
4250,"What part of...

>that has nothing to do with the claim that endorsing someone would somehow prevent her from doing her job. 

...are you having a hard time understanding?!"
4251,I don't need hands on experience in Washington to know what you said was ridiculous. 
4252,"""left-wing revolt"". They're the most centrist part of a center left party."
4253,"So sad. ""Conservatives"" weren't expecting the rest of us to push back. They thought we'd just be happy to find a new normal, but we've decided to hold them to account AND push our priorities. This is how they express their concern. "
4254,"THis article is totally missing the features of the EU project that I suspect the socialists in Europe most object to  - which is ""austerity"" as enforced by the ECB.  In that framework, financial disasters were visited on Spain, Italy, France, and even to an extent, the UK.   The UK still fails to make public investments in health and environment in the London metropolitan area.   And fails to invest in the health of the oceans of the North Atlantic. In the U.S. this approach led to years of slowed growth in the 70s and 80s, as Federal expenditures on environment and health were stopped. "

An NBC News analysis of the main English-language news sites employed by Russia in its 2016 election meddling shows Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is set to make her formal announcement Saturday, has become a favorite of the sites Moscow used when it interfered in 2016.

Several experts who track websites and social media linked to the Kremlin have also seen what they believe may be the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard.

Since Gabbard announced her intention to run on Jan. 11, there have been at least 20 Gabbard stories on three major Moscow-based English-language websites affiliated with or supportive of the Russian government: RT, the Russian-owned TV outlet; Sputnik News, a radio outlet; and Russia Insider, a blog that experts say closely follows the Kremlin line. The CIA has called RT and Sputnik part of ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine.""

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/russia-s-propaganda-machine-discovers-2020-democratic-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-n964261"
4300,So all they have to do to discredit democratic candidates is to simply write about them.
4301,You can write her in dude.
4302,"It's hard to trust. Too many times it's come out that the Russian chatter wasn't real or that some company made it's own bots to spread propaganda, then charged someone else to discover the "" Russian"" bots. 

It's become to easy for these experts to fake a problem so that they can continue making money fixing the problem. "
4303,The sources for that claim are all NBC employees or discredited
4304,>articles that fall on the approving side
4305,"Nah, bots don't have hands so they can't write."
4306,V true!
4307,"happy to see your source on that. Especially since many other international sites have ran this as well, so they vetted it.

But while you look for that source ill just leave these here:

may 2017: If Gabbard had indeed “long” called for a special prosecutor to oversee the Trump-Russia investigation, surely there would be a statement about it on her website? The only statements on her website with the words ‘Trump’ and ‘Russia’ are about the meeting she had at Trump Tower with the president-elect arranged by Alt-Right Breitbart boss Steve Bannon who wanted her to be Secretary of State and her warning [try not to laugh] about nuclear war with Russia in response to Trump’s airstrike on her favorite war criminal Bashar al-Assad.

heres RT times gushing all over her, so not sure how that NBC report was debunked when this is exactly what they claimed was happening: 

2019: https://www.rt.com/usa/448632-tulsi-gabbard-negative-reactions/


2018: https://www.rt.com/op-ed/444719-tulsi-gabbard-anti-dem-establishment/"
4308,"Big deal. If it's that easy to discredit a democratic candidate, Trump will be facing an empty field."
4309,"""*NBC News, to Claim Russia Supports Tulsi Gabbard, Relies on Firm Just Caught Fabricating Russia Data for the Democratic Party*"" by Glenn Greenwald"
4310,"You're not really making sense. Obviously National Review will rake some Dems over the coals, and given their perspective, we can dismiss that out of hand. The problem lies in this conservative publication's *praising* a particular Dem politician."
4311,"literally just posted RT articles form the past few years gushing all over her, which was NBC's claim. Not hard to google ""Russian media that backed Trump"" and then google ""RT and Tulsi"" and see for one's self. "
4312,"And I'm saying that anyone can write an article praising or denigrating anyone in any magazine, especially when the stakes are this high. 

If all you care about is whether or not someone appeared in some publication or the other without a word as to the substance of the piece then Trump has a sure shot path to victory."
4313,Like Republicans on MSNBC fawning over Harris? What about Conservative writers at the Washington Post praising Klobuchar? 
4314,">literally just posted RT articles form the past few years gushing all over her, which was NBC's claim. 

Read the article again, it wasn't. They claimed that ""experts"" had identified Russian coordination, citing the same firm that was caught lying about that before.

RT, like the BBC and CBC, is a government news source allowed to discuss matters from whatever angle they choose. Coverage of a politician doesn't equate to foreign influence in the election, that makes 0 sense. People can make up their own mind as to the trustworthiness of those sources.

The American view of politics is not intrinsically the right one, and foreign coverage is not intrinsically wrong."
4315,You're taking what I wrote a little too literally.
4316,"Oh, MSNBC and WaPo are widely known as conservative outlets?"
4317,Tulsi is probably Republicans' favorite Democrat. She even considered working for Trump. If it was one or two articles that would be different 
4318,No. You just need to get it through your head that the substance matters more than blind allegiance.
4319,"No one's saying anything about ""blind allegiance."""
4320,"Discrediting someone solely because a right wing outlet wrote about them is pretty much ""blind allegiance."""
4321,So at the end he didn't think she should be prosecuted.  
4322,"So wait...the last five Directors of the FBI, the entire counter intelligence division, all of the Mueller Dream Team are garbage partisan hacks but some no name counsel said at one point he was for prosecuting Hillary until he was convinced otherwise... that’s the best you’ve got? "
4323,">Nevertheless, Baker suggested that high-level officials convinced him that Clinton did not have the necessary ""knowledge or criminal intent"" to be charged.

--

>""And I understood that, that you had to be persuaded, and stated as a basis that ultimately you were persuaded there was a lack of evidence establishing knowledge or criminal intent, correct?"" the lawmaker asked.

>Again, Baker replied, ""Yes.""

Crazy, after gathering all the facts he reached a different conclusion."
4324,She is never going to have sex with you.  Make like Queen Elsa and let it go.
4325,Rent free.
4326,"Holy shit what a paltry attempt at a sensationalized headline. You do realize that the next sentence after “until” can only mean “no, I don’t think she should be prosecuted” right? How is this even newsworthy? And seriously, get the fuck over it. She’s not running. She’s no longer in politics. Give it a rest. "
4327,With all the millions and billions she's supposedly laundered and stolen I'm amazed she lives in such an empty space just because it's rent free.
4328,Is this it?  Is this the final straw?  Do we start the impeachment process yet?
4329,Hillary Clinton continues to live rent free in your head.
4330,I downvote Fox and don't clink any of their links.

4338,"This story should highlight how there were people involved with the investigations that were driven by partisan politics to get Hillary no matter what and needed to be convinced by others that the evidence didn't support charging her. They're very adept at spinning things in the complete opposite direction of where the facts lead by only being open to information that supports their bias. No wonder they act so indignant about their positions. Everything supports your viewpoint when you allow yourself that kind of rigidity. 

I think there's a certain egotistical blowhard mindset that processes information in ways that makes them actually believe these manifactured ideas and stances are somehow rooted in logic. Especially when you can chaulk up any information that contradicts your viewpoint to 'fake nooz' being spread by your percieved enemies. It's a neat little closed system they have going on there."

4340,Last time I checked Fox News isn’t getting sued for $250 million for writing fake ass stories.

Keep up the what aboutism....that is a real bad game to be playing for the GOP....the corruption is unrivaled, but you now have a singular thing to fall back on versus the absolute mountain of BS the GOP is pulling.  Suspicion of incorrect stories is basically the same as treason, election fraud, campaign finance violations, money laundering, violating the constitution, obstruction of justice....basically making every effort possible to destroy democracy in America....basically the same though right?"
4342,"It’s so fucking hilarious how much Dems made fun of Trump for implying he might not accept the election results before the election then they turned around and did exactly that. They cried like little fucking babies and they’re still crying. Republicans are destroying democracy even though they’re not the ones bitching about a democratically elected candidate. Right. Gotcha.

Color me skeptical.  China has no incentive to complete a trade deal with the Orange Idiot that doesn't heavily favor them.  They can just wait out his inevitable cardiac and negotiate with whoever comes next after tariffs are lifted."

""It's just too early to say, but I think there are a lot of early indicators that, yes, he would be a formidable candidate against Trump,"" Tracey, who made the case for why Sanders is a formidable Democratic candidate in an op-ed for The Federalist this week, told hosts Krystal Ball and Buck Sexton on Wednesday. 

Tracey argued that Sanders's strength with Midwestern voters, many of whom Trump was able to win over the in 2016 general election, could hurt the president's standing in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. 

""Recall 2016 in the Democratic primaries, one of Bernie Sanders most surprising wins against Hillary Clinton was the Michigan primary,"" he continued. ""That I think spoke to some of his intrinsic strength in, especially the upper midwest."" 

""He did extraordinarily well in Minnesota where Trump actually came pretty close to beating Hillary,"" he said. ""Just from a geographic standpoint, he has already demonstrated certain levels of aptitude for reaching voters in those states that swung to Trump.""

4476,Bezos still quivering
4477,"“None of this is to compare Ocasio-Cortez falsehoods to Trump’s ... But...”

Translation: This isn’t whatabout-ism, but whatabout..."
4478,"Let's break the article down ladies and gents, as OP is being very annoying:

>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has made a bigger splash than any freshman in the 116th Congress

Agreed.

>And a big reason is an often-overzealous conservative effort to knock her down a few pegs. The congresswoman has put on a PR master class in using those efforts to build her profile and social media following. (Her retort to the overblown dancing-video kerfuffle last week has been viewed nearly 20 million times.)

So right off the bat OP hes pointing out how dumb conservatives are in their attacks on her. Ya know, kind of how you're obsessed with her. His first point is on the claim of missing 21 trillion in the Pentagon. AOC got that wrong, but a NYT article points out the following:

>I wouldn’t want the taxpayer to confuse that with not — with the loss of something like a trillion dollars. It’s not. That wouldn’t be accurate,” Mr. Norquist said. “But it’s an accounting problem that does need to be solved, because it can help hide other underlying issues.”
In an interview, Professor Skidmore faulted the Pentagon for its lack of transparency and expressed skepticism that mismatches in property evaluations could account for all $21 trillion. He noted that large state governments like New York and California will make similar adjustments, but equivalent to small percentages of their budgets — not magnitudes larger.
The Pentagon’s adjustments could well be “accounting gimmicks to reconcile accounts, fine — or something else, I don’t know,” Professor Skidmore said. “I’m just absolutely perplexed. Why not have the underlying information?”

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/politics/fact-check-pentagon-medicare-alexandria-ocasio-cortez.html

So although she is incorrect about the money just missing, she raises an important question as outlined in the article I quoted. This is still a major problem, and I thought trump supporters wanted to get govt spending under control?

Now, on the idea that you could be morally right and therefore the facts dont matter, Blake also says this:

>But this is the slipperiest of slopes — the kind of attitude you can use to justify pretty much anything to yourself. And it also just so happens to be the underlying ethos of the entire Trump presidency.

So he clearly isnt supporting trump here OP. So again, your blind obsession with AOC has led you to look foolish, since the article clearly says trump is the worst person when it comes to this. 

>Trump has made more than 7,000 false claims as president, and to the extent his base of support processes those false claims, it has essentially dismissed them as unimportant in the scheme of things. Most recently, this has taken the form of saying or suggesting terrorists are flooding the U.S.-Mexico border, despite Trump’s own State Department saying there is no evidence that even one has crossed

When will you post articles about all the presidents lies, OP?

>None of this is to compare Ocasio-Cortez’s falsehoods to Trump’s; she’s right that there is no comparison. 

You posting this looks more and more foolish the more I read, yeesh. 

>People need to recognize that “morally right” is a subjective definition, and there need be no choice between making your case and using actual facts.

This is debatable. 

So all in all, if you posted this to trash AOC it doesn't really do that. It does say she got something wrong, but, then reminds everyone trump is way worse. 

You let me know when you want to post about his lies and crimes OP. You sort of just punked yourself.

Lastly, here's why the entire article is complete and utter bullshit.  From the article:

> He was revealed to be removed from the list of renominations Trump issued on January 22. 

Trump's people removed him from a nomination list. This had nothing to do with Democrats. McConnell and Senate Republicans has shown he is fully ready to utterly destroy the nominating process and corrupt the judicial branch, up to an including stealing one SCOTUS seat (and hundreds of lower court seats) and putting an openly biased, lying, booze-loving, rape-enabling, perjurer on SCOTUS. If they wanted this guy on the list, he would be on the list. "
4632,">That's the problem. You assume that their religion will circumvent fair application of the law. That's not necessarily true.

No. The problem is that the nominee is completely unqualified, and has never held even a minor judgeship before. Given this, we have no judicial record to turn to for reassurances that he is capable of setting aside his personal beliefs as required by the law. Instead, what exists for our scrutiny is his history of making inflammatory public statements on issues that might come before a federal judge.

If he were qualified, we could instead judge him on his merits and his history of impartially applying the law."

4641,We're not talking about 'decisions'.  We're talking about law and legal interpretation.  There's no place for morals or religion there.  Those only create bias and preference for certain groups.

As long as he's willing to violate the teachings of the Catholic Church, he can be a judge all he wants. But he shouldn't **want to**. His job has become an idol at that point. 

> Christian people have absolutely governed fairly in the past, just as non religious people have not governed fairly and unbiased.

Of course they have. But they had to violate the teaching of their faith to do so. I'm glad they were able to make that sacrifice. I'm not.

Come back when that discriminatory shit is fixed. Until then, this faux victimization rings as hollow as it actually is. "

4767,he isn't entirely wrong though...the way free or super cheap college works is by highly curating who actually gets to go by having a series of tests at various points in the student's education career.  Look at England...you take the GCSE test at mid high school age...if you don't pass you are done with school and better go find a job.  Then you take A-levels if you want to go to college...don't pass them and you are done with school and better go find a job.  This way the state can fund those that it considers as likely to be a return on that investment.
4768,"It's responding to your idea that a German-level tuition would be a dream. Germany cannot afford to send every one to college for free, but they can afford to send all of their best students to college for free, and that's what they do. This of course means a large amount of the population does not get to go to college, which runs against the ""college for everyone"" ideal we have here. And since blacks tend to score much lower on tests than whites, doing that system here would mean they get into college less, which would be called racist. Forget that Asians score better on tests than whites and would thus be over-represented by population, they don't count. "
4769,How is this different from the SAT test?
4770,"Yes contrast that with the clearly superior US system where people who can't get into state school go to for-profit schools that teach without accreditation and provide massive debt (backed by the US government) for degrees not worth the paper they're printed on, or better yet could have gone to a state school but instead are tricked into thinking these for profit-degree-mills are better and then are in the same boat."
4771,"Nobody ever talked about sending everyone to college for free. 

Just because Berkeley's a public school, doesn't mean it's not hard as hell to get into. SAT Reading and Writing 620-750, Math 650-790. And it's not whites only, Jim Bob...

Deflection. Pure and simple."
4772,"By the time you take the SAT England has already put you through a cycle that will kick you out of school once and they dont have endless schools like West Virginia University and Radford that will accept any underachieving loser with a checkbook and a keg tap.  When schools aren’t massive profit centers they have zero incentive to accept some loser that never tried in high school just to get his money.  Also there is always some school willing to take your money no matter how shitty your SAT score and high school transcript are...our federal government shouldn't be paying for them...it should be paying for the people that worked to go to college because they are the ones a college degree will pay off for...and I don't say this to malign not going to college, there is nothing wrong with that, going to learn a skilled trade is extremely valuable and is a perfectly acceptable life choice that you have no reason to go to college for."
4773,"The problem is that there is a finite amount of desks at colleges in the US. If they are to be given to people for free then, like Germany, they'll likely go to those most likely to succeed at post-secondary. In the US the problem becomes worse since the quality of education varies a lot depending on where you live. Upper middle class and above students do better on tests because our way of funding schools means they receive a much better education than a student from a poor area does. 

Tuition free college implemented today would end up being a handout for financially well off white people (primarily). It's not as though I don't support the idea, I do. But there's 112 things that need to be fixed in our education system to make it a fair and equable idea first. "
4774,"I really can't understand how people get so worked up about this.

We just gave a $10 trillion tax cut over 10 years to the wealthiest heirs and corporations.

If middle class kids get tuition free for about 7.5% of that cost over 10 years, I really don't see why anyone would get worked up about it.

Wealthy people generally do not send their kids to public schools anyways. And this would only be for public schools. 

Yes, there will still be inequities. No, everyone won't be able to get in.

But it's not like we don't already use tax money to subsidize higher education. In state tuition is already subsidized to some extent. Pell grants provide federal tuition support to students. So current policy already uses tax dollars to subsidies public higher education. The question is not whether or not we should be subsidizing it. It's only a matter of degree: To what extent should it be subsidized? How indebted should students be when they leave?

Those are the real questions. If it costs about $100k to send a kid through public college for 4 years, and the state and federal government now pick up $50k of it, I really don't see how picking up the other $50k is such a controversial move.

Why is it that when the mega-wealthy want free money, nobody bats an eye, but when the middle and working classes want a fraction of what they get, everybody loses their minds?

It's not that you're wrong that there'd be inequities. But I actually think that it's hard to argue that the relative change from the status quo would be less equitable. If you've got other ideas to improve life for people, great! But hesitating to back this one because it's not perfect seems like letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. "
4775,"> But I actually think that it's hard to argue that the relative change from the status quo would be less equitable.

It could be, if we assume (and I think it's a good assumption) that public schools are the cheapest, and most accessible schools out there. If they become free that increases demand, and limits the number of entries. 

So it could be that every middle class kid in the suburbs, who has access to good primary education thanks to schools being funded through property taxes qualifies for the free education. While someone growing up in inner Kansas City can't meet the increased standards to get into free college thanks to increased demand.

Thanks for your response, and sorry for the late reply I basically put my phone down for the weekend. 

I quoted the part I did because it highlights a significant problem. We do saddle students with a ton of debt. And it has to do with the way we fund post-secondary schools. There's legitimate reasons for the cost of an education to rise faster then inflation. But public funding doesn't, so schools raise tuition, which is possible largely because of guaranteed loans. 

Capping tuition would go a long way to helping student debt. And increasing public funding directly to schools might be a more equitable solution."

Currently we spend between 10 and 11% servicing our debt.  As interest rates rise in better economies (as we all hope to be moving towards) this cost will rise quickly.  In a few years, we could be spending more on debt servicing than the military (~15%)

**Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**

Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. 

**Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**

Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. 

**Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** 

The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 

**Supremacy of the Military** 

Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. 

**Rampant Sexism** 

The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. 

**Controlled Mass Media** 

Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. 

**Obsession with National Security** 

Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. 

**Religion and Government are Intertwined** 

Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. 

**Corporate Power is Protected** 

The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. 

**Labor Power is Suppressed**

Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed . 

**Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** 

Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. 

**Obsession with Crime and Punishment** 

Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. 

**Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** 

Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. 

**Fraudulent Elections**

Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

4900,"This was my lawsuit.  The problem with the law is that it criminalized free speech including speech that embarrasses somebody.  I'll demonstrate an example of the speech it criminalized:

&#x200B;

Donald Trump sucks.  Donald Trump sucks.

&#x200B;

That comment repeated above would be worth one year in jail, assuming a jury found an intent to embarrass, under the law the ACLU of Washington and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and my lawyers had knocked down.  Even in the likely case Trump doesn't read it.

&#x200B;

Certainly you would hope that our prosecutors and rational people would not choose to use such a law in such a case.  But they do.  Government is fire.  As Patrick Henry said, we must hold to our rights as holding to a precious jewel.  Simply look at the facts of my case to see an example.  A good place to start is the ""Not Clarence Moriwaki of Bainbridge Island"" Facebook page that has been re-published with the court victory.

&#x200B;

I criticized a public figure for his hypocritical partisan use of our public memorial and for representing our wonderful memorial with its motto ""Let It Not Happen Again"" commemorating the lessons hopefully learned from the internment of Americans under FDR, because he vocally supported politicians who literally made it legal to repeat that exact thing with the NDAA of 2012 including having Jay Insleee (who voted for presidential power to use military to indefinitely detain Americans in America without charge or trial) be the featured speaker at the memorial during an event.  That's criticism worthy.  So I did so, to the public and I did so civilly.

&#x200B;

In response, the friend and former staff member of Jay Inslee, Clarence Moriwaki, called that Facebook page cyberstalking and while he was literally liking calls for my death on his own Facebook page, I was disarmed and forced to turn my firearms into the local police department (same with my wife), censored, excluded from a portion of my own private property that I own outright, excluded from that event at the memorial where Jay Inslee was the speaker and excluded from civic events.  I was also placed in a position where this liar, Clarence Moriwaki, would be free to lie about my proximity since I lived in the condos near him and our walk to the ferry to go to college in Seattle would certainly place me in that position given that we all walk to the 90 foot wide ferry to commute (and I had to stay 300 feet away from him at all times).  So I had to flee my home.  Moriwaki is nothing if he's not a serial liar in the extreme as has been documented.

&#x200B;

So for criticizing him as being a hypocrite who didn't actually care about the rights of Japanese Americans who were excluded from our island in violation of their constitutional rights in the 1940s, he had government exclude me from my home on Bainbridge Island in violation of my constitutional rights.

&#x200B;

This law was a tool of tyranny.  Nothing more.  Again, you can see the Facebook page that started all this to evaluate for yourself now that it has finally been re-published.  ""Not Clarence Moriwaki of Bainbridge Island.""

While we need to take any accusation seriously, he does deserve an investigation before we throw him to the wolves.

If he sincerely is innocent, I understand him using this charged rhetoric. It basically means a scheme was concocted to falsely accuse him (which we [know has been attempted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/30/robert-mueller-targeted-sex-misconduct-hoax-fbi-review/1821254002/), and Lindsey Graham [even once openly threatened](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/lindsey-graham-threatens-to-falsify-accusations-of-assault-against-democratic-supreme-court-nominees/)). If he's guilty, well, then fuck him."
4917,Well that's not going to help his case in the realm of public opinion.
4918,"Guilty people can if they know there’s no evidence for an investigation to find. By everyone’s own admission he did have a sexual liaison in 2004 with the first accuser. They just disagree on the consensual nature of it.  But what is there to investigate? She didn’t make a police report right after. There’s no contemporary documentation showing she reported or tried to report a crime. Or even contemporary circumstantial evidence like text or telling a friend. She did let others know about her accusation years before Fairfax became Lt Gov. which bolsters her credibility with the general public and media, but that’s not admissible evidence of a crime. So since it has been so long and they both admit to having sex, and the accuser has came forward already with all her evidence and it’s only circumstantial though compelling; what is there for an investigation to find? 

Nothing. So even if he did it. He can be confident it will end up unsubstantiating the accusers claims. "
4919,"He's a former federal prosecutor. He knows that there is very little chance of 20 year old accusations, without immediate corroborating evidence, being found anything other than inconclusive. And you will notice that he isn't asking the relevant Massachusetts or North Carolina criminal authorities to investigate, he wants the FBI to investigate a non-federal crime (which they don't do).

This isn't saying he is guilty or innocent, but he knows a hearing in the VA Senate is likely going to be political theater that dooms him politically no matter what and an investigation is likely to never prove his guilt or innocence, but it will give him more political cover.

In short, it is all political calculus."
4920,"Well, it may or may not.

It is clearly trying to get the black community in VA firmly back in his corner. And its trying to get the white liberals whose favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird (don't take this last sentence literally). You have to assume that he has already written off a large population of the electorate (GoPers, etc)

But the accusers are black women. So I think this won't work all that well. It would be much easier to sell lynching as an argument if the accusers were white women.

Definitely an interesting political tactic, if you divorce it from the question or guilt or innocence "

4950,">On the bright side, the differences between the US and UK mean this issue may never turn so toxic for Democrats. The American Jewish community is bigger, more politically confident, and more firmly aligned with Democrats. The radical left that has so inspiringly emerged in American politics seems more savvy and more effortlessly intersectional than our UK equivalent. But if the American left is about to have its own reckoning with anti-Semitism, please don’t make the mistakes we did. Don’t stumble into a situation that, in the [words of one young Jewish Labour member](https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahalothman/these-young-labour-activists-say-being-a-jewish-member-is), is now “**painfully and hopelessly shit**.” 

I love the language in British politics. 

That being said, there is another factor that comes into play. ""Virulent anti-Israel themes"" is one of the tools used by Russian trolls, and these trolls  [have made sustained, ongoing attempts to influence discussion in the US left and right.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-you-found-in-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/) Russia has a long history of discrimination against Jews, and [as recently as 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia#Russia_today) there was a movement to ban Judaism in Russia. I don't see Russian anti-Semitism disappearing anytime soon.

I expect Russian trolls to continue to use anything that appears to get traction to try to create divisions. Israel is one easy way to do this. For example, if Jews want to participate in a progressive movement or project, the trolls can encourage [progressives to demand that any Jews denounce Israel before being allowed to participate](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-how-jews-became-too-white-too-powerful-for-u-s-progressive-activism-1.6849454) even if the project has nothing to do with Israel.  

As the article points out, it is easy to criticize Israel without being anti-Semetic. American and Israeli Jews do it all the time, so there are plenty of examples to follow. Another way to avoid the trolls' trap is the use of empathy. How would I feel if someone applied a similar standard to me?

The growth of Nazis is somewhat tied to how anything negative about Israel is antisemitic these days, because it has devalued the real problem so much that people like that don't actually see anything negative in the term or in actual antisemitism.

Just because someone is unaware of why a claim of antisemitism is made doesn’t mean that claim is invalid. 

“In November 2012, now-Representative Omar tweeted the following: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” 1 Some will say that this is hardly evidence of antisemitism, as Omar is clearly referencing the actions of the Israeli government, and not Jews. This is ok. The Israeli government is not above reproach, nor should it be. In free and open societies, Jews and non-Jews are permitted - and I believe morally required - to express their disapproval of actions they believe are wrong. Personally, I find current political trends in Israel disheartening. The government’s capitalization on fear and jingoism do not serve the interests of a stable, successful Israel. Mistreatment, abuse, and persecution of Palestinians - a people deserving of self-determination and independence just as we - is abhorrent. That being said, I believe her statement is antisemitic. It is steeped in antisemitic canards, and while making no explicit reference to Jews, it is clear to those with the knowledge of the historical context that it is indeed. The key to understanding why this statement is antisemitic, is the use of “hypnotizes”. Now, I get it. That’s just one word, and how can one word be the basis upon which we stamp the label “antisemitic”. In referencing my earlier statement about antisemitism intertwining with the development of society, Jews have been for centuries ascribed the insidious quality of utilizing underhandedness and chicanery to bend global governments to our will, prioritizing the Jew over other groups. We can similarly understand the use of Israel having a “stranglehold” over American politics. So when people use this term, in the context of Israel the nation-state of the Jewish People, it evokes, preys upon, and exploits centuries of libel against Jews. To then continue denying this context, is to silence Jewish concerns over our participation in society.”"

More: those who object to these inversions are told – as they were by David Ward – that they are acting in bad faith, only being concerned to deflect criticism of Israel. In short, the Holocaust, an event accurately described by Dan Diner as a ‘rupture in civilisation,’ organised by a regime that, as the political philosopher Leo Strauss observed, ‘had no other clear principle except murderous hatred of the Jews,’ is now being used, instrumentally, as a means to express animosity towards the homeland of the Jews. ‘The victims have become perpetrators’ is being heard more and more.

Headlines such as ‘The Final Solution to the Palestine Question,’ references to the ‘Holocaust in Gaza,’ images of IDF soldiers morphing into jackbooted storm troopers, Israeli politicians morphing into Hitler, and the Star of David morphing into the Swastika, are all increasingly common.

“Now to the more recent statement. On February 10 of this year, following a tweet from Glenn Greenwald lamenting “how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation”, Representative Omar responded simply “It's all about the Benjamins baby” 2. Again, there’s nothing inherently antisemitic about expressing concern over influence a foreign country may have over our domestic political discourse. Also again, context matters. Omar’s glib response expresses an understanding that the “pro-Israel” lobby in the US functions by bribing our politicians to support policies they otherwise would not. Her response is steeped in a history of non-Jews ascribing certain immutable traits to Jews, traits that describe us as others (Jewish Americans are not “true” Americans, because we have “dual-loyalties”), and that we are all wealthy, and that we seek to use this wealth to control world governments. All this is not even touching on the fact that AIPAC is not a political action committee, it is a political affairs committee, meaning that AIPAC does not contribute to political campaigns and does not donate to politicians. This is also not touching on the fact that actual foreign lobbies - registered agents of those countries’ governments - from countries other than Israel spend more than Israel’s on lobbying our government.”

"
5017,">AIPAC is as much a ‘vehicle’ for Israel as pro-rainforest groups are ‘vehicles’ for Brazil. 

The issue is that AIPAC acts for Israel at the expense of America.  AIPAC pushes for billions of dollars of US aid to Israel (most recently, a $38 billion package signed in 2018). This transfer of wealth happens while Israel has universal healthcare for its citizens and the US does not.  Why doesn't America keep that money to pay for the healthcare of its own, suffering citizens?  Because of AIPAC's actions.

From the *New Yorker*:

>AIPAC's leaders can be immoderately frank about the group’s influence. At dinner that night with Steven Rosen, I mentioned a controversy that had enveloped AIPAC in 1992. David Steiner, a New Jersey real-estate developer who was then serving as AIPAC’s president, was caught on tape boasting that he had “cut a deal” with the Administration of George H. W. Bush to provide more aid to Israel. Steiner also said that he was “negotiating” with the incoming Clinton Administration over the appointment of a pro-Israel Secretary of State. “We have a dozen people in his”—Clinton’s—“headquarters . . . and they are all going to get big jobs,” Steiner said. Soon after the tape’s existence was disclosed, Steiner resigned his post. I asked Rosen if AIPAC suffered a loss of influence after the Steiner affair. A half smile appeared on his face, and he pushed a napkin across the table. “You see this napkin?” he said. “In twenty-four hours, we could have the signatures of seventy senators on this napkin.” https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/04/real-insiders

Stereotyping all the the Bernie Sanders fans because you disagree with the extremely rare Trump voter who was a true Sanders fan is a bad way to justify shitty behavior.

5251,It's not a shitty comparison. There was plenty of vitriol coming from Clinton voters towards Obama. The point is you don't get 100% of your primary opponents voters. It just doesn't happen. If you want to dive deeper there's plenty of reason to believe the Bernie voters who went for Trump weren't even democratic voters. They were Republican voters that Bernie had pulled to the other side. This conversation is an irrelevant waste of time but I'm not the one who brought it up. I'm just pointing out why it's stupid to complain about a small and normal percentage of primary voters not voting the way you wanted them too. Obama didn't need the \~25% of Clinton voters who voted McCain. By your logic Trump was so bad Clinton really shouldn't have needed the \~10% of Sanders supporters who voted for Trump. 
5252,"20+ years is a really small sample size, and your argument and parameters are arbitrary to end up with your given outcome. "
5253,"> So Nixon couldn't win because he lost against JFK? Amazing how flexible BernieBro logic gets to justify the unjustifiable.

>> A candidate that wins the primary but doesn't win the general election **generally** should not.

If Hillary were to run again, she would be running against Trump a second time while he is the incumbent President. When Nixon ran in 1968 for President again after his attempt in 1960, he ran against Hubert Humphrey in the general election and not against an incumbent president. 

That's why I said that candidates *generally* should not run again but there are exceptions such as when they aren't running against an incumbent.

> Just seems like BernieBros will make any excuse to try and justify not having a woman or POC running.

If you have to resort to calling me a BernieBro and assuming I'm a white man, it's obvious you're not arguing in good faith."
5254,"Yup. I’m one of those HRC supporters who is still pissed about Bernie’s behavior during the election. I’m not going to let his supporters whitewash his behavior or his Bernie Bros behavior. 

With that said, I will 100% vote for him if he wins the nomination. "

The other comment pointed out Nixon, which would have been 1968 which obviously fits under ""20 **plus** years"" ago."
5258,"Circular BernieBro logic is the worst logic. So you say it's Ok for Bernie to run because 
... reasons. But, at the same time, it's NOT ok for HRC for the exact same reasons?

P.S. Nina Turner is a BernieBro and is neither white nor male. Get off your high horse please."
5259,"He literally campaigned with her after she won. His behavior was just fine. If you really want to talk about behavior... Why is it that Hillary came up with a nick name for Obama voters and now Bernie voters? Why is it that 30% of Hillary voters voted for McCain?

30Million voted for Bernie. Hillary got 60+ million in the General election. There is a huge double standard here. It makes zero sense for you to be going after Bernie supporters when they already acknowledge how nasty both sides got. But it really makes no sense when more Hillary supporters turned away from Obama.

5263,Does it matter? Someone always has to make the first move and decide that people who believe in the right outcomes but disagree how to get there should not abuse each other.
5264,"I don't actually care about the ""x years"", I'm saying there isn't enough sample size, in the history of the United States, for you to make that claim.

Your assumption is that a candidate who made it to the General election and LOST didn't have the support to win. In this case, the candidate who made it to the General election and lost actually won the popular vote. All I'm saying is that Hillary's chances of winning are most likely *at least* as good as Bernie's, if not better. (My own personal favorite so far is Jay Inslee, who has zero chance). "

Actually I am *not* making that assumption. It is obvious however that I might be oversimplifying the situation based on past election records.

The original point from the person I responded to in this comment chain was suggesting that Bernie shouldn't run because he lost the 2016 primary and that there are candidates now with similar platform policies.

My post wasn't meant to be a diss at Hillary. I merely suggest that she shouldn't run because she lost the 2016 general election and would be likely be facing the same general election candidate (Trump) should she run again in 2020."

5273,Right. Cuz there definitely weren't any Hillary supporters that trashed Bernie every chance they got. 
5274,"Thats pretty ignorant to think extremism doesnt exist on both sides of the political spectrum. The party system is inherently polarizing, when one side goes further and perhaps into extremes of their side, the opposite does the same. Now for the past 100 years we've had immense corruption and special interests controlling each respective party but some of the morals of each side get a little ridiculous. The extremism within each party drives the opposite side further away from the other (like with talk about ""post birth abortions"" for instance) no one does that but it pisses off the other side. It widens the divide between the 2 largest demographics in our country. I personally believe its a divide and conquer tactic to keep us distracted by the largest financial, energy, and military institutions that pull the strings of pur politicians. A kingdom divided amongst itself cannot stand, especially against powerful corporate entities. So the bullshit of both sides keeps us angry and constantly in conflict with the other side of our political views."
5275,"Yes, you said you were frustrated."

The GOP started creating a Trump back in 1964.  That was entirely their aim, all along, using mainly racism to encourage people to vote against their own interests.

He is aaaalll theirs, no one else's."
5281,"That's a pretty shitty source, OP:

Rupert Murdoch bought the Post for US$30.5 million.[3] Since 1993, the Post has been owned by News Corporation and its successor, News Corp, which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988. Its editorial offices are located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue). Its distribution ranked 5th in the US in 2018.

The Post has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservative bias. In 1980, the Columbia Journalism Review stated ""New York Post is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem – a force for evil.""[43]

Perhaps the most serious allegation against the Post is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.[44]

Critics say that the Post allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. Former Post executive editor Steven D. Cuozzo has responded that the Post ""broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda.""

According to a survey conducted by Pace University in 2004, the Post was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it ""not credible"" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).[45]

The Public Enemy song ""A Letter to the New York Post"" from their album Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper. 

There have been numerous controversies surrounding the Post:

In 1997, a national news story concerning Rebecca Sealfon's victory in the Scripps National Spelling Bee circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the Daily News, a direct in-market competitor. Post published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the Daily News as printed on a placard she was wearing.[47]

On November 8, 2000, Post printed ""BUSH WINS!"" in a huge headline,[48] although the presidential election remained in doubt because of the recount issues in Florida. Like Post, many other newspapers around the country published a similar headline after the four major TV networks called the election for George W. Bush.

On March 10, 2004, Post re-ran, as a full-color page one photograph,[49] a photograph that had already been run three days earlier in black and white on page 9, showing the 24-story suicide plunge of a New York University student, who had since been identified as 19-year-old Diana Chien, daughter of a prominent Silicon Valley businessman. Among criticisms leveled at Post[50] was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false impression that it was taken during her fatal act, despite the fact that she had fallen face up.

On July 6, 2004, Post ran an article claiming to have learned exclusively that Senator John Kerry, the Democratic Party's Presidential nominee-in-waiting, had selected former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to be the party's Vice Presidential nominee. The article, under the headline ""KERRY'S CHOICE"", ran without a byline.[51] The next day, Post had to print a new story, ""KERRY'S REAL CHOICE"", reporting Kerry's actual selection of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina as his running mate.

On April 21, 2006, several Asian-American advocacy groups protested the use of the headline ""Wok This Way"" for a Post article about Bush's meeting with the Hu Jintao, President of the People's Republic of China.[52]

On September 29, 2006, Post editor Sarah Polonsky was fired abruptly for accepting gifts.[53][54]

On September 27, 2006, Post published an article called ""Powder Puff Spooks Keith"" that made fun of Countdown host Keith Olbermann receiving an anthrax threat from an unknown terrorist.[55]

On December 7, 2006, Post doctored a front-page photograph to depict the co-chairmen of the Iraq Study Group—James Baker and Lee Hamilton—in primate fur, under the headline ""SURRENDER MONKEYS"", inspired by a once-used line from The Simpsons. In defense of the ""Surrender Monkeys"" headline, media contributor Simon Dumenco wrote an Ad Age article about his love for Post.[56]

On February 18, 2009, Post ran a cartoon by Sean Delonas that depicted a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a chimpanzee on the street: ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" The cartoon dually referred to President Obama and to the recent rampage of Travis, a former chimpanzee actor; it was criticized as being in bad taste, primarily by making a reference to the racist stereotype of African-Americans being portrayed as apes.[57] Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called the cartoon ""troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.""[58] Post has defended itself by stating that the cartoon was deliberately misinterpreted by its critics.

In 2017, the New York Post was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. President Donald Trump,[80][81] who maintains frequent contact with its owner, Rupert Murdoch.

The Post has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that Post loses up to $70 million a year.

5282,"I wouldn't read this article but I'll still say that racist complaints against Asians are being used not to prop up Asians but to create a new (old) form of ""equality"" where we just do our racial discrimination and nobody talks about it anymore."
5283,"I find it really weird that Asian Americans are in opposition to so many programs designed to promote equality for Hispanic people and African Americans. I don’t want to call them pawns, because they’re intelligent adults with agency. It just seems odd. I’m sure I just don’t understand their motivations.

It’s particularly odd because I have repeatedly found myself in conversations with Asian Americans about how ‘other minorities don’t pay attention to Asian civil rights causes.’ I don’t understand why the Asian community would expect other races to take up their causes as our own... Particularly because Asian American’s connection to modern civil rights movements tends to be standing with white America in opposition.

I’d love an answer from an Asian American interested in the subject."

Because it's a zero sum game. For example, in this instance at the NYC specialized schools, Asian Americans currently make up 62% of students when it's on a purely meritocratic basis (test scores). The *obvious* goal of changing the admissions criteria is to increase the # of Blacks and Hispanics who don't qualify under the current criteria.  After having changed the criteria, every increase in a Black or Hispanic student who wouldn't have previously been accepted is at the expense of the Asian who would have been had it remained based on meritocracy.

&#x200B;

I agree with the statement that Asian American civil rights causes are not given attention by other minorities (I'm Asian, btw). I think it's because the success of Asians in American society belies many of the assertions of those who advocate for affirmative action policies, particularly for Hispanics who were never affected by slavery like Blacks and are new immigrants or were systematically oppressed like the Native Americans (both of whom an argument can at least  be made for). Then of course, you have immigrants from Africa, benefitting from affirmative action whose families were never affected by slavery (such as Obama). As for your statement about Asian American's standing with white America in opposition--that's ridiculous--opposition to what, exactly? Quotas and policies that adversely affect them? Asian Americans are naturally going to seek out their own best interests. That doesn't make them anti-civil rights, they are protecting their own.

Affirmative action should only be based on socioeconomic status, not ""race.""

2. Going with a moderate who wants to return calm, rational governing to the White House that isn’t always straining to get the headline.

I see merit in both. 

My sense is, in the Midwest, where the Electoral Race will be won or lost, people want to tap the brakes on the radical changes coming from Washington. Many of them supported Trump, because he was an agent of change, but now are souring on him because of the way he’s handled the Presidency and how he’s actually gone and done the things that previous Republicans only *talked about.* I think they’d like a chance to reset things, if not all the way, then most of the way, back to 2016 and start over.

5689,"""What if it covered abortion?""

That would be great. There is absolutely no reason not to. It is a health concern that should be treated by a healthcare provider and covered by health insurance. Not rocket science here. "
5690,You mean...it doesn't do that now?  Are you people a full-on theocracy?
5691,It should.
5692,It's interesting because I am very pro-choice and also very pro universal health care but for some reason never thought about this dilemma. It's a curious predicament considering the Hyde Amendment.

Obvious disclaimer - if there's an actual health risk involved for the mother, then by all means that's a different story. "
5703,lol that’s not how insurance works. What if we started applying this logic to other medical procedures? What if people didn’t want to pay for your liver transplant because you’re an alcoholic?

5712,">They got elected by lying to voters, signing illegals up for driver's license ID's and stuffing ballot boxes with ""absentee"" ballots. 

Do you have sources for all of those accusations? The only thing I can find that's close to this is the [election fraud in North Carolina](https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/02/18/politics/north-carolina-9th-district-hearing/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) where absentee ballots were collected in an attempt to bolster the [Mark Harris campaign](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-north-carolina/north-carolina-hearing-on-alleged-election-fraud-enters-third-day-idUSKCN1Q91R7). "
5713,Do you have any idea what a pregnancy does to a woman's body? Abortion is very much a necessity if a pregnancy is unwanted.
5714,"The thing is . . a face lift is cosmetic, and a face lift is not time-sensitive.

If a woman is pregnant, no matter the outcome, she will likely need medical care or guidance.  If she carries to term and gives birth, she should be receiving prenatal care and labor and delivery care.  If she has a miscarriage, she may need miscarriage management by a doctor.  If she has an abortion, she will need a doctor to perform the procedure or guide her in the medication abortion process.  It seems . . . strange to me that a woman having the need for a doctor for her abortion (her choice) is not covered by her insurance, while a woman having the need for a doctor for her carrying the pregnancy to term (her choice) is *not* covered by her insurance.

There's also the time-sensitivity of abortion; you can hold off your liposuction, or even get by saving up money for a kinda-elective/kinda-not procedure like a knee replacement.  But if you hold off on getting a timely abortion, you end up either with a late-term abortion, or a child.

And there is of course, finally, the question of welfare.  If you cannot use your public insurance for a procedure like a face lift, nothing happens.  If you feel you cannot adequately provide for a child and cannot access an abortion, carrying to term and raising that child will likely use more public taxpayer funds to cover the cost of the birth as well as financial assistance for the family.  The existence of welfare is a godsend for those who need it; the question is- why would we go to lengths to make a woman carry to term and birth a child she doesn't want?  In the long run, it is far more cost-effective to invest funds in contraception and abortion than to work denying either and laying out more money to support the children they were trying not to have."

5719,"I can see the wisdom of where you're coming from.  No telling how many women would have abortions for the sheer fun of it if we were to allow them to have as many as they wanted without having to pay for them.  Anyway, poor people never get pregnant without meaning to, or have fetuses with serious problems, and they're the best at caring for kids they don't want, who never become a societal problem.  "

Countless election results were overturned in 2018. Ballots were ""found"" in cars, storage rooms, school closets where polling stations were. Look up ""chain of custody"" laws. Every one was violated.Hours, days and in some cases weeks later they were still counting illegal ballots. Weren't you watching the news?, shit it was even on CNN & MSNBC .

5745,"> There were some obvious problems with the story. First, Chicago is not exactly MAGA country — Trump won 12.5 percent of the vote in the city precincts. Second, it seems unlikely that people would stake out Smollett in the middle of the night in below-freezing temperatures. Third, Smollett somehow retained hold of his sandwich after the alleged assault. Fourth, he strolled through his apartment complex without notifying the doorman of the incident. Fifth, he waited 40 minutes to call the police. Sixth, when the police arrived, he was still wearing the clothesline around his neck. Seventh, Smollett claimed that his manager had been on the phone with him at the time of the alleged hate crime; when asked to turn over his phone to the Chicago Police Department to verify this, he refused to do so. 

Well, if you ever want an example of how the right-wing media just kinda passes off wild speculation as news, it doesn't get much better than this paragraph."
5746,"Considering Trump just decried the New York Times as the enemy of the people, this article is irresponsible and ill-timed.

To be fair, it's possible the article was submitted before Trump's latest tweet-storm.  Also it's true that some journalists possibly got ahead of themselves in the Smollett case.

That said, the MSM's reporting (sans Fox) on the Trump administration has been, almost without fault, meticulous and precise.

Given the fact that we've already had lunatics sending pipe bombs to politicians and newsrooms, as well as active shooters, this headline alone is incendiary and unprofessional."

Let's hope UNL does the same. Why? Representatives of a university are held accountable for their teachings and conduct while performing their duties both on and off campus.

Professors at all universities should leave activism to the students. Why? Because this is where students learn the most about life, social issues and educational freedom. "

Professors have their own ideas, too, and there are many famous activists who are also professors, some who achieved professor status based on their work as activists. I don’t think that they should engage in activism in the classroom, but participation in a completely legitimate part of the political process should be open to everyone.

5928,"Trying to divide the Democratic Party no doubt.

They also seem to think Trump would crush Bernie in the general by playing the Socialism, Venezuela card.

Problem for them (and corporate Democrats) is Bernie doesn't bite, and when the average Republican hears about higher taxes on the wealthy, reigning in Wall Street and multinationals, expanding Medicare to all people, reducing foreign wars, etc. they actually like a lot of what he's saying."

I'm just saying what I think--and the answer is that we cannot become to divisive on candidates and let them drive a stake between progressives and centrists. We need a candidate everyone can get behind, and I think in the next year that will slowly take place "
5936,"I think you should phrase that differently, I thought you were being sarcastic until I saw your other comments in the thread."
5937,"Bernie thanked those women for speaking out and explained what caused the problem. His small campaign unexpectedly exploded, so it didn't have good infrastructure. His recent Senate campaign addressed that issue and his 2020 campaign is extra focused on it too.

What has Kamala Harris done to fix her problem? There was a $400,000 harassment settlement in her campaign."
5938,Breitbart is shit. There is absolutely no reason to listen to anything they say. Certainly don't try to use them to divide us. You can do much better than helping out Republicans. 
5939,I like both Bernie and Biden. At least for the most part.  But I really want a candidate who is younger than 70.  
5940,Bernie called for Al Franklin to resign on less evidence and no investigation. Why shouldn’t Bernie do the same?
5941,Kamala Harris should resign first. She hasn't addressed her problems.

The true outsiders in national US media are the ones who report on and condemn all of the wars and regime change. All of the mosque bombings. All of the domestic spying. All of the torture in other countries. All of the bombs and guns sold. Al Queda has American military equipment. How? Some of Americas largest defence contractors are working with the same people that were found to a literal war criminals to sell Nuclear power generation technology to Saudi Arabia, the same people giving American arms to Al Queda.

5946,All Logan is doing is stating the obvious.
5947,">This is reflected in the low levels of trust that the American people have in the media. Her comments are clearly seen in findings from Pew Research Center that 73 percent of Republicans believe that the mainstream media does not understand their views. A recent study by the Knight Foundation found that 49 percent of high school students have little to no trust in the news. **A poll by Monmouth University last year also found that 77 percent of respondents believe that traditional media outlets publish fake news**

>Among that group, 31 percent said they believed the media spreads fake news regularly while 46 percent said the media spreads fake news occasionally. **A stunning 65 percent of respondents said fake news applies to how media outlets make editorial decisions and what they choose to report.**

American mistrust in mainstream media is growing. Any ideas why?"
5948,The correct answer.
5949,Is bias against bad ideas and poor leadership a negative? 
5950,Sometimes the obvious needs to be stated
5951,There is an entire industry of websites / talk radio / FOX (is somehow not MSM to conservatives) that tells people not to trust the media.
5952,*Active Measures*
5953,">The Monmouth University Poll also finds that Pres. Trump is trusted less as source of information than three cable news outlets – except if you ask Republicans. Nearly half the American public (48%) trusts CNN more than Trump, compared with one-third (35%) who trust Trump more than CNN and another 13% who trust both equally as a source of information. The results are similar when Trump is pitted against the left-leaning MSNBC – 45% trust MSNBC more, 32% trust Trump more, and 16% trust both equally. The right-leaning Fox News also bests the president as a trusted information source – 30% trust Fox more and 20% trust Trump more, although a plurality of 37% trust both equally.

>The results for the president versus MSNBC have not changed much in the past year (47% trusted MSNBC more, 33% trusted Trump more, 15% trusted both equally in March 2017). The pendulum has swung slightly but not substantially away from Fox News and toward Trump in that matchup (37% trusted Fox News more, 17% trusted Trump more, 36% trusted both equally in March 2017). CNN was not included in the 2017 poll.

>It should come as no surprise that many more Republicans trust the president as an information source than either CNN (12% versus 75% for Trump) or MSNBC (11% versus 72% for Trump). But Republicans are also somewhat more likely to trust Trump (35%) over Fox News (21%), with 40% trusting both GOP-aligned sources equally. In 2017, 29% of Republicans trusted Trump more, 26% trusted Fox more, and 44% trusted both equally, marking a slight gain for the president in the current poll.

>“One bright lining in the whole fake news debate is that major cable news operations are still more trusted than a single officeholder. Unless you are a Republican, in which case Trump’s Twitter feed may be your go-to news source,” said Murray.

It's a dumb premise, in part because people have been demonstrated to have a very poor grasp on the idea of risk, so getting anyone to understand how much more age-related risk there is for a 79 vs 83-year old man would be pretty friggin impossible. "
6001,"This article makes the argument that everyone else is a lame duck because they have to focus on reelection rather than issues:

6007,"The Intercept is actually a fantastic news source. They just aren't under the thumb of some big mega-corporation, so they get smeared. They also don't have that limitless budget, but they do really good for what they have, and often report on things the corporate media is deliberately ignoring (like Standing Rock). "
6008,I'll take the Intercept over Politico or Washington Post
6009,My favorite intercept journalism bit was when they literally sent scans of documents to the NSA for confirmation (rather than the info in a new format) and in doing so completely blew Reality Winner's cover.

6013,"I agree 100% that we need someone who can 'beat Trump', but Im starting to solidify a slightly different take on the issue.

Im thinking that if people on the left (that means anyone center to....the far far left of spectrum) vote for the person that they feel the most passionate about *instead* of the one they 'think' can beat Trump but they aren't very passionate about, (for me this would be Biden) then we are guaranteed to pick someone who *won't* beat Trump. 

Im looking at this primary as the most exciting of my life because we have *so many amazing people to chose from!* Im going to pick the person that alines with my views as closely as possible, which at the moment is Harris and Warren, and Im starting to really like the Senator from NY as well. 

In theory, if each of us picked the person we are really excited about, then the person who wins will be the one with the strongest, most excited base. Then if the rest of us 'vote Blue no matter who', I really think *that* person, no matter who it is, can win.  "

>They’ve also discussed an idea some donors and supporters have been pitching Biden on directly for months: kick off by announcing that he’d only run for one term.

6158,"A Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist who was arrested in Maryland last week was plotting to kill a long list of prominent journalists and Democratic politicians, as well as professors, judges and what he called “leftists in general,” federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday.

Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, was arrested Friday on gun and drug charges, but prosecutors said in the filing that the charges were just the “proverbial tip of the iceberg.”

The filing argued that Lieutenant Hasson should be held until he is tried, describing him as a “domestic terrorist” who intended “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.”

Prosecutors quoted a letter that he drafted to friends in 2017 and that the authorities found on his computer. In it, Lieutenant Hasson, who works as an acquisitions officer at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, wrote: “I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed / Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax not sure yet but will find something.”

Plastic surgery is like the steroids of TV news and politics. It really shouldn't be allowed, because it starts an arms race and it's not healthy. But the vast majority of them do it. So it's jarring to us to see someone on TV who hasn't. And TV news always describes people who don't do it as ""disheveled"" or ""old"" or something like that."

No, people are not saying that sanders has mental decline. "
6214,Maybe? We don't know yet and he's been acting like he's going to.

6216,When he does we can see how the polls shape up. Until then I think when we’re discussing candidates we should limit it to the candidates

Bernie Sanders is very old. That is something that people will discuss. Sanders is fine today. How will an 80 year old Sanders be? How will 4 years of hard work impact him? At 84 will he still be in good shape? At 88? 

They are legitimate questions. Pointing out the mental decline of Reagan or Trump is valid, and asking if similar *could* happen to Sanders is sensible. 

People get old. They decline. They die. That will happen to Sanders as it happens to all people. 

If you want to ignore the conversation, feel free to. "
6218,So you haven't mentioned anything about Bernie before he declared on articles about other candidates? I highly doubt it. 
6219,You just said no one is saying sanders is having a mental decline then said it’s exactly what your discussing and it’s a legitimate question. I’m only saying that you should be honest from the start and say that’s exactly what’s happening here. It’s disingenuous to put on that facade then tell me to ignore the conversation when pressed.

6228,"She should never be allowed back, nobody who left the US to be an actual terrorist should be. She chose to leave a modern westernized country to be a literal terrorist in a war torn hell-hole, wishing death on the people who were once her neighbors.

Nowhere in that article that you cited does it state that she wants assurances of  no jail time.  According to that article, she worries that  she may be jailed even though she thinks that therapy should be her punishment.

>Muthana said US diplomatic officials had not contacted her yet and worries that if and when she returns to the US, she will be separated from her son and jailed.

What experience does Abrams have with domestic policy on a national level? None.

What experience does Abrams have with foreign policy, on any level? None.

>Governors are recurring prime candidates for the presidency and they have no national level chops.

Being a Governor is literally the tip top state-level executive position and governors deal with national policy on a daily basis. There is a big difference between being a governor and being an *almost-governor*. 

The fact is that Abrams has neither leadership experience that she would have if she had been governor for even a few years, nor the experience with national domestic and foreign policy issues that a good and successful president (i.e. not Trump) requires.

>If you are light on experience, you fill your cabinet with people that make up for it.

I'm sorry, but this is absolutely a Trumpian argument. If that's the case, why not just make any random person the president?

A great cabinet and insightful advisers are definitely paramount to running the country, but ultimately the final say on key decisions comes down to the judgement and experience of the one person sitting at the desk in the oval office.

Like I said, there's zero doubt in my mind that Abrams would be more effective than somebody as inept and clueless as our current ""president"", but, personally, I'd rather see someone with more knowledge and experience under their belt.

6412,"I simply can't support someone with an religious-right, anti-gay history. She may have evolved a few after announcing her bid, but my evolution on her is a bit slower.

I also am not a fan or her foreign policy positions. There's a big, BIG difference between being ""anti-regime change"" and being ""pro-regime"". In an era of foreign influence and the new cold war, I'm very skeptical of her motives, to say the least.

Gabbard is by far my least favorite. Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, is great--but lacking experience.

I'd vote for Sanders/Abrams in a heartbeat. I'd be very reluctant to vote for Sanders/Gabbard, but ultimately ousting Trump is the most important thing."
6413,">So you're saying you'd sit out or vote Trump if he picks Tulsi?

*I'd never vote for Trump and I don't ever waste my vote,* but I absolutely distrust Tulsi and disagree with her positions present and past. Her record is all over the map, and she is simply unfit to represent a economically AND socially progressive Democratic Party.

I would almost certainly end up voting for Bernie with Tulsi in the end, only because I'm pragmatic and I understand that the most important thing is for Democrats to win and for Trump to be removed from office (and hopefully prosecuted for his crimes). If the polls showed a viable 3rd option or independent candidate who actually had a real chance of winning, I'd consider that.

So would I fall in line? *Probably.* But the possibility of Bernie picking Tulsi certainly makes him far less attractive to me as a primary candidate, however.

**edit:** Luckily, I personally think the idea of Bernie picking Gabbard as a running mate is a troll's wet dream and has little basis in reality. He's much more likely to pick someone like Harris or Abrams to broaden his appeal instead of shrinking it. I would vote for Sanders/Harris or Sanders/Abrams in a heartbeat. (And let's face it, Bernie excelled with white working-class voters but really struggled with minority voters last time. Winning over both is key to winning big, and someone like Harris or Abrams might help with that.)"

You surround yourself with bright people and make informed decisions.

3) She's a Yale law grad who has lived in Wisconsin and Georgia.  She has been personally wounded by GOP corruption if not robbed of an election win.  She would be a minority in a still-very-white DC. Those are solid reason I, at least, would want her representing me.

4) She would be VP, and it's not like she's going to be president the minute she gets into office.

I still reject DC experience as a requirement for high office.  I reject it not only for her but also for all candidates.  I reject it historically as a complaint that I've never found useful.  If that's her main weakness, that's good to know because it only reinforces what I see as her strengths.

6445,">She would be VP, and it's not like she's going to be president the minute she gets into office.

One last issue, if Bernie is nominated and wins, he'd be the oldest president ever, in fact, older than our national average life expectancy. I see his VP pick and their level of readiness to be even more relevant and worthy of consideration than typical. The same thing applies to Joe Biden, so it's not a anti-Bernie thing, by the way.

You'll say she's a hawk, false again, she's anti-terrorist, which Bernie is as well, he also supports usage of Drones

6459,">I admire people who can walk away from bad influences and especially don't blame them for being born into a shitty family.

I think that's respectable, but unfortunately that's not really the case with Tulsi Gabbard. It wasn't just that she was passively influenced by her parent's bigotry--Tulsi was actively involved in anti-gay political organizations as an adult. 

It's one thing to be brainwashed into personally thinking homosexuality is immoral by a religious organization or your upbringing but, to me, it's a totally different level of shitty behavior to be actively involved in public campaigns of persecution against gay people.

Frankly, Tulsi has a Mike Pence-level history of words and actions against LGBT rights that is barely in the mainstream of politics in general nowadays, and it certainly is well outside of the mainstream of my pro-civil rights Democratic Party.

She claims to have changed, just in time to run for President, and I hope that she has changed, but that's hardly enough for me right now which makes positions her in dead last place for me.

(The Assad thing is a separate issue, also important and worthy of scrutiny, but not as important to me as domestic civil rights and equality.)"
6460,Is that not ok?
6461,"What are you even talking about? Am I not allowed to even think about voting for anyone other than Bernie Sanders now, even if he pairs up with someone like Tulsi Gabbard who is totally against my socially progressive values and principals.

I will vote for the person who is most likely to beat Trump. If that person is Bernie Sanders with Tulsi Gabbard, i'll vote for them. If there is another viable option that isn't paired with a anti-gay, pro-assad, wacko--then i'll vote for them instead, as is my right.

Luckily for me, I don't think i'll have to make that choice, because Tulsi is not VP material and Bernie is smart enough to know that. She's trash, and she's not a progressive."

Nobody gives a shit about Turner or Gabbard except people who are already 100% behind Sanders. They gain zero voters and douing down on ""hey, fuck the Democratic Party"" loses a ton (as well as a ton of volunteers and organizers and so on).

You may want a colored non-cisgendered person to run and win POTUS but there's more to campaigning than one's genetics and sexuality. Candidates need platforms and policies to offer the people, and then the people will have to decide which policy they prefer. Those lacking in substance will not make it far.

It's a fair point that class probably nets you a larger group, but acknowledging the *how* and *why* these class disparities exist when it comes to minorities is important. They are there for different reasons than just corporatism: huge cultural and policy factors are involved that are only tangently related to corporatism play a role.

One of Sanders's greatest failings as a candidate in 2016 (and IMO probably the primary reason why he lost) was that he did a poor job of communicating where these issues intersect, which made the minority communities that compose a huge portion of the Democratic base turn away from him. The message came off that addressing white working class angst was more important than their concerns (whether he meant it or not).

It is not language 'of the left'. He does not know who 'the Left' actually is and seemingly you don't either.

If there is anyone who will put up the hard fight that can make, say, Medicare for All a reality, it is him. That would be a tie breaker for me, though there is no tie to break considering he is so far ahead on this metric."
6564,"Yeah, that's pretty much why I'm waiting to hear every candidate's goals before I start jumping to their support.

For example, if Beto O'Rourke, who may have feared pulling the progressive trigger in Texas, announced his candidacy and came out unabashedly progressive for a national platform (which Wisconsin Republicans think he will), I might end up supporting him especially after his success at turning out so many voters in Texas, a beneficial quality to have. But it all depends on whether or not he's willing to put up a strong progressive platform.

If not, Elizabeth Warren is up there as well in my top choices, as she has the right ideas in place much like Bernie. It all depends what these candidates will stand for because this country is in need of real reform.

Also, I'd like to add, whoever wins the presidency in 2020, they'd better goddamn make sure they appoint Adam Schiff to U.S. Attorney General."

Good point. Although not usually what identity politics refers to. And in my opinion, it's slightly different in that wealth inequality of the current magnitude is a threat to democracy and the stability of the union.

Explaining how gender and race effect people'seconomic prospects is a tall order. Clinton didn't have any special powers in this area, but she did perhaps more clout as a woman candidate.

I do think Sanders, as a white old dude, might have trouble inspiring people of color. However, I don't think his loss was primarily because he didn't cater to identity. I think it was because of Clinton's name recognition and the fact that the machinery of the DNC was behind her.

And I still think when you have the sound bites talking about a specific subgroup, you'll have a lot of voters who will say ""what about me? I hurting too."" I'm not saying that's right or good, but it is real. White middle america doesn’t want to hear about ""white privilege"" when their suicide rates are through the roof and their kids are dying in droves from opioids. Even if white privilege is the cause of many, many, many problems in America.

6570,">Explaining how gender and race effect people'seconomic prospects is a tall order.

It's a tall order, but it's absolutely vital for Sanders to do so if he wants to avoid the ""what about me"" factor you referenced. This is especially true in the Trump era where if you're a minority you have to deal with direct existential threats to your basic human rights that are again more culturally driven than by corporations. It's a little hard to be concerned by rural white poverty when the spectre of being detained by ICE just because of your ethnicity hangs over your day to day life. As Trump became the front-runner Sanders never really spent much time on these issues that *also* constitute a huge threat to democracy and equality, and it hurt him mightily with minorities.

I think the numbers definitely back up the idea that overall he didn't do well with these groups and that his message didn't really resonate with him. Clinton *clobbered* him in these demographics, and I believe there's a pretty good history behind the idea that *without* the support of these constituencies you're not likely to get the Democratic nomination."

6576,">However, blacks under 30 were only 3 percent of the Democratic electorate in these states. In contrast, blacks over 60 were 7 percent of the electorate in these states.

Not huge inroads really, especially when you look at the margins for other demographics or compare the under 30 #s to other groups. Blaming this disparity on a fear of socialism is also a fundamental misunderstanding of these communities. MLK was a socialist! Ideologically, minorities have always been more open to socialist ideas than white America.

The real difference in the demographics is proximity to and lived experience with the civil rights era. These are people with real memories about the time and how closely Trump's policies aim to go back to before those gains. That's visceral, and candidates can't really forget how that collectively impacts how these communities approach politics."
6577,That’s anti-Semitic. Jewish people face discrimination and have been the target of terrorism in this country the past year+. 
6578,"That’s *also* anti-semitism. It’s not ‘cutting both ways’. When people say oppressive Jews run the banks and the media etc, that’s just more anti-semitism."
6579,"But older voters have been operating under the truism that ""a socialist could never win"". Bernie thrashed fallacy (as did candidates like AOC). I still think aiming for a united message rather than little messages is the right answer. If this presidency hasn't convinced people of color that one side cares more the other, nothing will.

A message around things that effect everyone like inequality, free college, subsidized daycare, and the environment is a better tactic with fewer drawbacks. Focusing on a tailored message to subgroups invites cries of favoritism (which helped sink Clinton). White grievance is Trump's best (perhaps only) card. Playing into it with identity politics is just bad tactics.

Hit him where it hurts. He's a poster boy for the rich and over privileged class. Squandering that bullseye on a nuanced discussion about race and gender isn't going to steal his voters from him. They don't care. Or at the very least they have more pressing issues like the disintegration of their communities and economic insecurity. I don't see the GOP suddenly becoming the champion of the oppressed minorities just because Sanders doesn't make their oppression his central issue. "
6580,"> That’s also anti-semitism. It’s not ‘cutting both ways’.

Again, I'm not the one making these claims. There are people on the far left who view some degree of anti-jewish sentiment as ""punching up,"" apparently on the theory that it's okay to be prejudiced towards people as long as they're doing well. "
6581,">White grievance is Trump's best (perhaps only) card. Playing into it with identity politics is just bad tactics.

The issue again is that this approach leads to the ""what about me"" problem for minority groups. Not engaging it gets viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that these grievances are legitimate. Minority voters will reject this in the primaries and Sanders will need them to win there. Sure, they'll still vote Dem in the general, but probably not with the turnout or enthusiasm we really need if that's the message. The midterms and special elections have shown just how big an impact turning out these communities can have.

>A message around things that effect everyone like inequality, free college, subsidized daycare, and the environment is a better tactic with fewer drawbacks. Focusing on a tailored message to subgroups invites cries of favoritism (which helped sink Clinton).

I think we generally agree here, but that doesn't mean that Sanders doesn't need to translate or sell this to minorities. Tailored messages *are* important. That doesn't mean saying wildly different things to different groups, it's just adjusting to the frame of reference they're approaching it from. Clinton's biggest problem was there wasn't really a coherent message at all, not that she took the same message and framed it to her audiences. This is an issue that is harder to thread for Democrats since we're the ""big tent""  party, but we have to thread it."
6582,"Silicon Valley will use their wallets for what's in their best interest. Businesses will play both sides and individuals will try to ""brand"" themselves with some political affiliation.

I imagine he will lose because the Washington Post will be able to say they were reporting with the best information they had available and when more information came out, they published that as well as issuing corrections to the earlier stories. In order to win this case, Sandmann's lawyers will need to show the Washington Post had access to information that contradicted what they intended to publish, but still published the false information. That is a high bar to reach.

6753,"No, only yours."
6754,"Nah, he's handing out straight facts, instead. "
6755,Still too difficult for you to understand that what he was clearly saying is that bread lines are better than poor people starving to death?
6756,Like under the depression?
6757,Exactly. I'm tired of hearing that any amount of progress or improvement is an attempt at utopia. This is possibly the dumbest argument I've ever heard and I've heard it often. 
6758,Me too.  And I can give him one primary vote (and hopefully one general election vote) to help move us that direction as well :)
6759,"So you might be right in that the editor who created the title might believe that.  But I feel bad for the writer, because I do think using the word Utopia sort of upsets both sides (to pro-Sanders people it sounds patronizing, and to anti-Sanders people it sounds like elevating his goals as utopian).

That said, the writer clearly put time into researching and listing his platform.  And below is his intro and closing paragraphs:

>Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is running in the Democratic presidential primary, but he's long been an independent who self-identifies as a democratic socialist. His vision for government is very different from the one currently employed in the US by either party.  
>  
>And his greatest accomplishment to date is leading -- or maybe reading -- a lurch to the left among a new, activist group of Democrats who aren't unnerved by the word socialist and want the government to guarantee jobs and health care to its citizens.  
>  
>How different would the country be if Sanders could get elected and deliver on his ideas? Here's a rundown of where he might start:

 

>There's plenty more Sanders would like to do, like end the war on drugs, eliminate privately run prisons and undo the [Citizens United Supreme Court decision](https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/politics/citizens-united-anniversary/index.html) on campaign finance.  
>  
>Any single one of the things above could be the main accomplishment of an effective president. Sanders can never be accused of keeping his campaign promises small. The question is whether the public is behind this vision for the country.

I sort of feel bad that the writer put all of this time into a well thought out article that doesn't use the word ""utopia"" once and then most likely the editor decided to call it that for clicks?  Change the title of this article to something like ""A detailed examination of Bernie's platform / vision for the country"" and you probably see a lot more interest in it (on Reddit at least)."
6760,Great way of putting it
6761,It is weird to think that Sanders has been in Washington longer than many users here have been alive.
6762,"I think he has a term in him, and he can definitely pave the way for the future.

his VP pick will be important.

like look who else do we refer to pubically by their first name? I don't want to be behind one candidate, I want to be behind a team and the party support, working for my best interests.

we've seen it firsthand from Pelosi. we need some of our veterans to pave the way. "
6763,">It is weird to think that Sanders has been in Washington longer than many users here have been alive.

He calls that being establishment. "
6764,"> his VP pick will be important.

It won’t make him a day younger, more female, or more diverse. You know, the people who were elected to control the House.  "
6765,"Since announcing it seems like his age, sex or color arent causing any issues for him. "
6766,"no, but having someone that is trusted by him and the public to carry on his policies and legacy will change our perspective.

no one's going to change his age, and he may pass away during his term so we need to have someone that can handle that."
6767,it also won't make him better at math.  If people love him so much they should leave him where he is to vote on legislation that any democrat president will sign anyways and not put him into a job he isn't fit for just because he says things they like.
6768,"> someone that is trusted by him 

Who is that?

An unnamed, mythical younger female?"
6769,"""first coast news""???

The attitude around 2004 was *""Fuck you liberal, look at how the Dow is doing, look at Mission Accomplished, game over!  We were right!""*



But...that was wrong. It all collapsed. And so the Right retreated into denial & ran away from responsibility.  And to compensate, they will swallow anything that let's them pretend they've always been the victimized good guys.

*The man you voted for is whining about not getting a Nobel Prize even though he hasn't done anything*. Indeed he may have jeopardize the existing negotiations that had started before he got involved in North Korea.


 


 Very simply:  the Right followed the failure of Bush with the failure of Trump...and now having to deal with the slow sobriety of reality,  they run to anything that allows them to pretend liberals are the bad guys and they should kneel before Trump.

You see, this is interesting to me. Because most of *my* gay friends were gay decades ago and they didn't experience any of that random violence. Random gay-bashing was something you vaguely heard about in a friend-of-friend-told-me sense.

Indeed, the world you're imagining is wildly out-of-line with the actual statistics you're pretending to follow.

Instead, we could achieve the same thing with no additional federal spending.  How can this happen, you ask?  Simply by drafting more stringent energy conservation requirements than what is currently required.

Now, of course there's a diminishing return on these types of improvements.  But the current energy codes were drafted 30 years ago.  You can't tell me that no new technology has become available, and its not worth taking another look at this today.

Thanks for letting me get that out."
7036,"Similar to the comment about renovating buildings I’ll drop this in about land usage. 

The BLM oversees 247.3M acres which is 1/8 of the entire US. CA is 101M total acres. 

The entire US is 2.3B with 1.9B acres in the lower 48. 

According to multiple studies (including the engergy dept) it requires just .6% or roughly 14M acres of land to completely power the US. 

Renewables already account for about 15% of energy production in the US with with wind (5.55%) and solar (1.3%) currently accounting for 6.85%. 

Unfortunately it’s extremely difficult to find out how much average is in use today. Why? Well partly because it’s hard to keep track and also because you don’t actually need all the land. Because panels can be mounted on buildings, layered into glass, shingles and placed under wind turbines, just to name a few places. 

Also as improvements in the tech is made you can get more efficiency (thus more energy) out of the existing land usage. Likewise depending if you are talking about passive panels, active trackers or concentrators you need various land usage requirements but generate varying amounts of energy. 

So do you need those 14M acres of which we have 247.3M to consider? Maybe if you want. Or you could use the thousands of acres already in use, or the millions of roof top acres, etc. to solve this same problem. 

Also none of this is considering offshore.

Same way Congress ""paid"" for tax cuts, by putting it on the Country's credit card (the national debt). Now, as I repeated in this thread, tax revenues will mitigate this, and, since it has been noted that AOC and other Dems want to put the ultra high end rate at about 70%, the odds that the middle class will feel that are nearly ZERO, since the 70% rate applies at incomes over $10 million.

[Now, there would a valid argument to be made regarding sheltering of such money to avoid the tax,](https://taxfoundation.org/70-tax/) however, tax revenue is not just derived from personal income. There are corporate taxes to consider. Since such revenues would go UP as a massive spending program like the Green New Deal filters to individual sectors of the economy, corporations will need to pay taxes on said income. Hell, John D. Rockefeller is considered to be one of the richest persons in human history (adjusted for inflation), and he had to pay a federal tax rate comparable to what is currently being proposed.

> And would it not have otherwise stimulated the economy?

This is the thing about Keynesian economics. If the U.S. was following what Keynes originally outlined in his economic theories, taxes should have RISEN during the Obama years to bring the federal budget to surplus and pay down the national debt. This did not happen, because those that subscribe to the failed supply-side economic fallacy have shaped policy to kneecap ourselves.

The article left out the word **felony**, as in felony arrest.  Which makes some difference.

They also left out the emotional crime that caused the over reach in changing the policy.

> Newsom changed this policy in 2008 after a 21-year-old undocumented man was arrested for murdering three members of a San Francisco family. The man had previously been arrested as a youth at 17 and was found guilty of attempted robbery and assault, but he was never reported to federal immigration authorities. After Newsom's change, the city began reporting arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE who were suspected of committing a felony, regardless of whether they were actually found guilty of a crime.

They also left out that policy was changed to conviction instead of arrest in 2011.

**TLDR**  Article misstated the policy, left out that it was a knee jerk political reaction to a horrific crime, and failed to mention the  policy was reversed.

> Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris this week mischaracterized a 2008 policy she supported that led to undocumented minors who were arrested for suspected felonies being turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement **before they had been convicted of crimes.**

> Speaking to an audience in Iowa Sunday on Political Party Live a podcast about Iowa politics, Harris was asked by host Misty Rebik about a CNN KFile report detailing Harris' public support for a citywide policy enacted by then-Mayor Gavin Newsom of reporting juvenile undocumented immigrants arrested by local police to ICE. **The decision revoked a previous policy of non-reporting.**

> In her answer, Harris called the reporting of arrested juvenile undocumented immigrants before they were convicted of a felony an ""unintended consequence"" of the policy that she did not support. However, this was in fact the intent of the policy.

> ... While Harris was correct that the policy has since been changed, it was the result of a change in administration. When Newsom left his position as mayor in 2011, his successor changed the city's policy so that police would only report unaccompanied juvenile undocumented immigrants who were arrested to ICE; and again in 2013 when San Francisco passed another ordinance which prohibited reporting any arrested person to ICE except in limited circumstances.

> There was an active push by the city's Board of Supervisors when Harris and Newsom were in city office to change the policy to prohibit reporting juvenile undocumented immigrants to ICE unless they had been convicted of a felony. **But those efforts were opposed by Harris and Newsom, with Harris saying in one speech she said the Board of Supervisors bill violated federal immigration law.**

Seems the people downvoting this don't know what ""Neoliberalism"" means:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism

>Neoliberalism or neo-liberalism[1] is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire economic liberalism and free market capitalism.[2]:7[3] Those ideas include economic liberalization policies such as privatization, austerity, deregulation, free trade[4] and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society.[12] These market-based ideas and the policies they inspired constitute a paradigm shift away from the post-war Keynesian consensus which lasted from 1945 to 1980.[13][14] "
7314,cringe 
7315,"Neoliberal = free market capitalist, left leaning on social issues.

My problems with this article: 

The term ""neoliberal"" isn't popular and was a poor choice for the title.

It's a stretch of the imagination to suggest that our economic policies have historically been directed by neoliberals and that economic policy is now somehow dead. 

Economic issues are have always been social issues.

I've personally never seen an economist analyze participation in a marketplace. The discussion is usually an analysis of the market and the efficiency of it, not utilization. 

There are no free markets as all marketplaces have a significant barrier to enter. Some marketplaces require enormous capital to obtain volume discounts that are competitive, so competition at different price levels is restricted.

Statements that need citations:

""For example, while the minimum wage debate continues, few would claim that it is an effective tool for intervening in labor markets with wages higher than a certain level.""

I don't see how it could be totally ineffective? Some people who are earning above minimum wage will feel that their income compared to minimum wage is not sufficient and will seek higher paying employment. That effect could decrease the demand for jobs paying slightly above minimum wage, causing employers to raise pay to increase the incentive to fill those positions. The employees make the corporate entity the profit, not the other way around. If the employer doesn't offer enough incentive to fill the position and no one does, the company can not generate profit. It bothers me that economists frequently apply backwards logic to businesses and jobs. Corporations do not exist to employ people, they exist to generate profit through collaboration between management and the employees to achieve their goals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
7316,"I agree. Neoliberalism has created this huge economic inequality that needs a serious correction. 

I blame it for the resurgence of Fascism, as people find they cannot afford housing, healthcare, higher education, etc, and so the Right then directs their hostilities onto ""those"" people, rather than on the class warfare being quietly waged by the wealthy against the masses. "
7317,"In same page,

>In 1938 at the Colloque Walter Lippmann, the term ""neoliberalism"" was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs.[24]:12–13[29] The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving ""the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state"".[24]:13–14 To be ""neoliberal"" meant advocating a modern economic policy with state intervention.[24]:48 Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing laissez-faire camp of classical liberals, like Ludwig von Mises.

So this is nearly the opposite of the way it was originally used. The modern use of neoliberal is dumb in that it fulfills no philosophical niche whatsoever and is simply an easy smeer for other social scientists to use on economists or liberal leaning philosophers that don't believe that socialism (in the literal sense of collective ownership of the means of production) is better regulated capitalism."
7318,"> Neoliberal = free market capitalist, left leaning on social issues.

Nope.  It's a right wing economic doctrine.  It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with left leaning on social issues.  It's an economic thing.  It isn't at all concerned with social leaning.

Seriously please stop making shit up."
7319,"Neoliberalism in it's current iteration is much more than just an easy smear. Neoliberlism, has evolved to encompass all the economic failures of classical liberalism and incorporates globalization and capitalization. 

""The Handbook of Neoliberalism posits that the term has ""become a means of identifying a seemingly ubiquitous set of market-oriented policies as being largely responsible for a wide range of social, political, ecological and economic problems"". Yet the handbook argues to view the term as merely a pejorative or ""radical political slogan"" is to ""reduce its capacity as an analytic frame. If neoliberalism is to serve as a way of understanding the transformation of society over the last few decades then the concept is in need of unpacking"".[5] Currently, neoliberalism is most commonly used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as ""eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers"" and reducing state influence on the economy, especially through privatization and austerity.[6]""

If you could explain that to me, I would appreciate it. Even reading wikipedia, under the section where is says ""what do neoliberals want?"" I see ""Social fairness"" and ""Equal opportunities for everyone."" Is your issue that I'm perceiving those as left leaning?

7324,"As I see it, in it's current form, neoliberalism doesn't promote either social fairness or equal opportunity. In it's inception, I think the idea of state intervention was included, but as neoliberlism evolved, it became more an iteration of failed classical liberal - laissez-faire - economics. For me, the state of neoliberalism is exemplified by the economic polices of the Republican Party in the USA. The GOP has stated goals including social fairness and equal opportunity, but actual economic policies inhibit achieving either.

I realize I would be going out on a limb here to suggest that it's distinctly different as Trump doesn't support free trade, but his actions on the tariffs don't necessarily represent the entire Republican party.

>The GOP has stated goals including social fairness and equal opportunity, but actual economic policies inhibit achieving either.

I'm not going to read it extremely carefully to look for an alternative wording, but the phrases ""equal opportunity"" and ""social fairness"" do not exist in the GOP party platform.

>I've never visited the Simple English version of Wikipedia and I must say I'm a bit skeptical of the accuracy of information there.

I would say that the exact definition of neoliberalism is somewhat debatable and it's usage has changed over time. I'll try to think a little bit more carefully about the context going forward. The article was obviously discussing neoliberalism as an economic ideology rather than a political ideology with a focus on laissez-faire economic policies. So your definition seems appropriate rather than the definitions that I am referencing."
7326,"""Fellow democrats"" says the new york post, while wearing a backwards baseball cap and slinging a skateboard"
7327,"Rupert Murdoch bought the Post for US$30.5 million.[3] Since 1993, the Post has been owned by News Corporation and its successor, News Corp, which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988. Its editorial offices are located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue). Its distribution ranked 5th in the US in 2018.

The Post has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservative bias. In 1980, the Columbia Journalism Review stated ""New York Post is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem – a force for evil.""[43]

Perhaps the most serious allegation against the Post is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.[44]

Critics say that the Post allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. Former Post executive editor Steven D. Cuozzo has responded that the Post ""broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda.""

According to a survey conducted by Pace University in 2004, the Post was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it ""not credible"" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).[45]

The Public Enemy song ""A Letter to the New York Post"" from their album Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper. 

There have been numerous controversies surrounding the Post:

In 1997, a national news story concerning Rebecca Sealfon's victory in the Scripps National Spelling Bee circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the Daily News, a direct in-market competitor. Post published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the Daily News as printed on a placard she was wearing.[47]

On November 8, 2000, Post printed ""BUSH WINS!"" in a huge headline,[48] although the presidential election remained in doubt because of the recount issues in Florida. Like Post, many other newspapers around the country published a similar headline after the four major TV networks called the election for George W. Bush.

On March 10, 2004, Post re-ran, as a full-color page one photograph,[49] a photograph that had already been run three days earlier in black and white on page 9, showing the 24-story suicide plunge of a New York University student, who had since been identified as 19-year-old Diana Chien, daughter of a prominent Silicon Valley businessman. Among criticisms leveled at Post[50] was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false impression that it was taken during her fatal act, despite the fact that she had fallen face up.

On July 6, 2004, Post ran an article claiming to have learned exclusively that Senator John Kerry, the Democratic Party's Presidential nominee-in-waiting, had selected former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to be the party's Vice Presidential nominee. The article, under the headline ""KERRY'S CHOICE"", ran without a byline.[51] The next day, Post had to print a new story, ""KERRY'S REAL CHOICE"", reporting Kerry's actual selection of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina as his running mate.

On April 21, 2006, several Asian-American advocacy groups protested the use of the headline ""Wok This Way"" for a Post article about Bush's meeting with the Hu Jintao, President of the People's Republic of China.[52]

On September 29, 2006, Post editor Sarah Polonsky was fired abruptly for accepting gifts.[53][54]

On September 27, 2006, Post published an article called ""Powder Puff Spooks Keith"" that made fun of Countdown host Keith Olbermann receiving an anthrax threat from an unknown terrorist.[55]

On December 7, 2006, Post doctored a front-page photograph to depict the co-chairmen of the Iraq Study Group—James Baker and Lee Hamilton—in primate fur, under the headline ""SURRENDER MONKEYS"", inspired by a once-used line from The Simpsons. In defense of the ""Surrender Monkeys"" headline, media contributor Simon Dumenco wrote an Ad Age article about his love for Post.[56]

On February 18, 2009, Post ran a cartoon by Sean Delonas that depicted a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a chimpanzee on the street: ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" The cartoon dually referred to President Obama and to the recent rampage of Travis, a former chimpanzee actor; it was criticized as being in bad taste, primarily by making a reference to the racist stereotype of African-Americans being portrayed as apes.[57] Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called the cartoon ""troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.""[58] Post has defended itself by stating that the cartoon was deliberately misinterpreted by its critics.

In 2017, the New York Post was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. President Donald Trump,[80][81] who maintains frequent contact with its owner, Rupert Murdoch.

Yet Post has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that Post loses up to $70 million a year.

The point of a “gun free zone” isn’t that it is intended to stop people from bringing guns into a specific area. The point is that law enforcement officers (whether public or private) now have a reason to remove you from an area because you have a gun before you would actually be able to use it.

>WASHINGTON – The House Judiciary Committee passed a measure Wednesday that would require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers within the United States, the most significant gun-control legislation to advance this far in Congress in years.

>The committee spent more than nine hours debating the bill before voting 21-14 to advance it Wednesday night. It will now face a vote on the House floor. The measure was among the first actions taken by the newly elected Democratic majority, which pledged to make gun control a top issue. The bill also has the support of at least five Republicans, a rare feat given that the issue often has cleaved along party lines.

>The committee also voted 23-15 to advance a bill that would close a loophole in the current background-check law that allows a gun purchase if a check is not completed in three days.

>Wednesday’s debate comes as Democrats embark on their most aggressive push to enact gun-control laws after years of congressional inaction. The House is slated to vote on several bills in the first 100 days of the legislative session and had its first hearing on a gun-control bill since 2007. It is taking numerous actions this week around the anniversary of the mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that killed 17 students and staff on Feb. 14, 2018.

>“I ask that we work together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans, to end this silence with action to make all of our communities safer from gun violence,” said Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland and held a moment of silence on the House floor Wednesday to honor the victims. “I ask that this moment of silence not be in vain.”

>The Judiciary Committee hearing became a rancorous partisan battle over whether to expand background checks. Republicans offered amendments to the legislation that were voted down by the committee, including one that would make background checks free and another that would allow transfers of firearms to victims of domestic violence without a background check.

>At one point, the discussion turned into a debate on immigration and border security surrounding an amendment that would require notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an undocumented person tried to buy a gun, with Republicans accusing Democrats of not wanting to secure the southern border. Republicans moved to adjourn the hearing in the ninth hour, a motion that was voted down.

>“I’m afraid what we are engaged in here is an exercise in obfuscation and confusion that is meant to mask the fact that the Republicans are not in favor of . . . the universal background check legislation,” said Rep. Hank Johnso, D-Ga. “They want to hold this up as long as possible and score political points and try to confuse people and scare folks.”

>In a video posted on the National Rifle Association’s Twitter account, Rep. Douglas Collins, R-Ga., a member of the Judiciary Committee present at the hearing, called the bill a “fraud” that “simply wants to get at your constitutional rights.”

7432,"The federal laws do not apply to many abusers who victimize non-spouse partners. Domestic violence affects people in family or intimate relationships that fall outside the protections of federal law. For example, dating partners are not within the federal prohibitions unless the partners have cohabitated as spouses or have a child in common. The risk of domestic violence being committed by a dating partner is well documented. In 2008, individuals killed by current dating partners made up almost half of all spouse and current dating partner homicides.12 A study of applicants for domestic violence restraining orders in Los Angeles found that the most common relationship between the victim and abuser was a dating relationship.13"
7433,"The federal laws do not apply to abusers who victimize a family member other than a partner or child. The current federal prohibitions also do not address violence against family members other than a child or intimate partner.

Sadly, absent a constitutional amendment, the ability to compel states to enforce federal law is an all or nothing proposition."
7440,"True, and then law enforcement sent him a letter requesting that he turn in his weapon. He didn't comply and they didn't follow up and confiscate it.

1. First background check for the Illinois FOID card.

7446,"1 and 2 are the same failure. If the conviction isn't in the federal database, it's not a failure each time you query it.

As for 3, that's going to require a lot more funding. 7,000 Illinois gun licenses are revoked each year without submitting a report showing they got rid of them. That's a *lot* of searches. It would account for the vast majority conducted yearly. Maybe a good compromise would be making it a felony to not submit a report. Then at least they have a warrant out."
7447,"The federal laws fail to require domestic abusers to surrender their firearms. Federal law does not require domestic abusers to turn in their firearms once they are convicted of a crime of domestic violence or become subject to a restraining order. As a result, abusers continue to commit crimes with guns they are prohibited from owning under federal law. In 2011, more than 50 people in Washington State were arrested on gun charges while subject to protective orders.17"
7448,"The federal laws are weakened because not all states report all prohibited abusers. In order for background checks to prevent abusers from obtaining guns, states must report abusers who fall within prohibited categories to the proper databases. Identifying the abusers to be reported involves a series of complex legal issues that many states have not yet addressed.18 As a result, many states do not comprehensively enter domestic violence protective order and offender information into the proper databases."
7449,"The federal laws are weakened by ineffectual federal background check laws. Federal law does not require a background check to be performed before every sale of a gun, including sales by unlicensed, private sellers. The private sale loophole enables many domestic abusers to illegally obtain the firearms they use against their victims. For more information about background check requirements, see our summary on Universal Background Checks."

7474,">The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. **Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep**. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe.

I have my own reservations about President Trump and his slogans and hats, but this is criminal and this guy should be charged. Pulling a gun on someone is a stupid stupid thing to do, especially for political views. It's like launching a missile at someone for flipping you off. Was what they were doing likely to tick people off? Possibly. Did they deserve to be harmed, let alone blown off the face of the earth? Absolutely not.

Politics becomes so important to people that they forget about the human on the other side. There are crappy people on both sides, and you can totally have your thoughts on who is worse and does what, but nobody deserves to die simply for their political views. There are other consequences that the worst can face but no individual should be the judge, jury, and executioner."

Take that disingenuous faux outrage elsewhere. It's not welcome here. America built itself into a superpower by killing Nazis, and we certainly as hell aren't going to let that go to waste by bowing to fascists now. "
7685,">""MAGA hat = you should be bashed""

No, I went out of my way to dispel that, at least from my own point of view. What I said was that maga hats are openly antagonistic. Even if people who wear them are just doing it as a joke or to troll people, it obviously has a deeper utility other than saying ""make America great again."" Denying that is totally disingenuous. I know you know this."
7686,"So what? That is completely unrelated to your dishonest statement or my response.

7698,"Finding.one is likely but some of those didn't happen, were after effects from previous years or are nearly true.

1.6 bil for the wall and ending NK nukes were just demands that proved to not happen at a later stage. I believe you though, there probably is one thing that's true."
7699,Sorry. I stopped reading the stupid after you said r/socialist is for Democrats. How ignorant can you be?
7700,"I up vote plenty of articles that are about Republicans doing something positive. Like the Republicans who are voicing their disapproval of Trump's unconstitutional power grab of calling a national emergency. I am not alone, tons of up vote here.

7743,I've seen the poll you're talking about and it's not really that solid. People in a poll said they wanted economic growth but many of them still question so much in tax rebates. If you think people wanted Amazon as much as the tax rebate you should consider a run for representing that area of New York since politics are one dimensional and that's how elections work.
7744,Sooo...now she went and scuttled the Amazon deal? I'm not following. That bird has flown. WTF do her thoughts about Amazon matter now?
7745,"I live in the city and I’ve yet to meet a single person who was happy about the Amazon hq.

Mona Eltahawy, a prominent Egyptian American feminist, tweeted a message from a Saudi woman explaining that while Absher is awful, having it removed will further restrict women. Before it came along, she said, granting travel restrictions was burdensome so guardians would use that as excuse to keep women at home."

It all stems from the alt right playbook. Always attack, never defend. The modern right fits perfectly within the Trump camp in that his entire modus operandi is that of a crude bully conman a virtual model upon which the alt right's tactics are built.

7814,"When the Ilhan Omar story broke, I mentioned here on Reddit that the reason people were calling it antisemitic was because the particular statement was not criticising Israeli policies or AIPAC stands, it was simply attacking the use of money by AIPAC to lobby. That was viewed as antisemitic because it wasn’t about lobbying being bad except when one group does it. If you imagine someone complaining that an African American group shouldn’t be allowed to lobby, you can see that disadvantaging one group can be an oppression. And when you are using words that tie into the negative stereotypes to do that disadvantaging, many people see that as a bigotry.

Anyway, I was downvoted - not heavily but predominantly. People who saw it mostly did not like that explanation. Responses showed that they instinctively read my point as saying people couldn’t criticise AIPAC.

7832,"Part of this is also due to the fact that Israel, AIPAC, and other supporters of Israel have long tried to conflate criticism of the state of Israel with anti-Semitism in an attempt to shield it from legitimate criticism."
7833,"And where was the outcry about antisemitism from the very concerned conservatives when Trump declared scum shouting ""Jews will not replace us"" to be fine people? Where was it over the constant attacks on Soros culminating in a bombing attempt? Where was it about a synagogue shooting that rightly qualifies as a pogrom? Where was it about the deeply antisemitic nature of Christian Dominionist?

7835,"Well, I came across your write-up in r/judaism, and if nothing else it convinced me you're arguing in good faith.  What I would say in response here is that: 

a) anti-Israel sentiment has been materially suppressed in DC for decades, not by Jews of course but by end-times Christians, so in this scenario I think Tlaib and Omar deserve the benefit of a doubt (though, of course, if they establish a pattern of behavior as time goes on, that's another matter)

b) there is so much false concern trolling really truly going on right now that any criticisms originating from or amplified by the right that aren't well-evidenced must, for better or for worse, be written off as hit pieces for the time being, and

c) what you said in your Judaism post about it not mattering whether the antisemitism is intentional is true, but also double-edged in that if the speaker's intent is ignored, then the speaker himself must also be ignored; thus if her comment contained anti-Semitic dog-whistles by accident, we can blame Tlaib perhaps for carelessness but not for the course of history.

d) navigating the complex relationship between Jews and Muslims muddies the waters further, and the whole thing smells more like a covert attack on Tlaib's religious affiliation than anything else, at least to me.  It's easy to convince people that a Muslim is anti-semitic, and it's easy to further convince people that an anti-semitic Muslim is anti-America.  "

7846,Why then are you using antisemitism as a cudgel to hammer down on criticism of a far right apartheid regime in Israel and the lobbying power said regime exerts over American conservatives?

This was particularly visible in the border towns where a power vacuum has occurred in the absence of El Chapo. For instance, officials estimate that 85 percent of the homicides in Tijuana are related to drug trafficking.

>Remarkably, there were a staggering 132 politicians or candidates murdered during last year’s campaign cycle. Often these murders were tied to organized crime. Either through intimidation or greed, there’s no reason to believe that the corruption enabling drug trafficking has diminished.

>And don’t think it ends at the border. Over 500 U.S. Border Patrol agents have charged with drug and corruption charges over a two-year period. That’s in addition to nearly 200 Department of Homeland Security officials and contractors who have been caught accepting bribes.  

>Nor is there any evidence that America’s insatiable demand for illegal drugs has subsided. In fact, the largest seizure of fentanyl (254 pounds) in U.S. history was made last month in the border town of Nogales, Arizona. Furthermore, a record-setting bust with 1.7 tons of meth was captured in Los Angeles earlier this month.

>Of course, it’s great news when someone like El Chapo—an agent of addiction, corruption, and death many times over—is taken off the streets. But his story only proves that the war on drugs is a Sisyphean pursuit. There are literally thousands of criminals fighting to take his place and one or more of them will likely succeed.

It is a pretty massive and idiotic jump to take what I said about waiting for facts and then assuming that I am against men and women being sexually assaulted.  That is just absurd what you tried to imply."
8141,"Them statistics don't really do your argument (what ever it is) any favours, possibly even subtracts from it."
8142,"Reddit is not a public official. You're not very good at using evidence to support your positions. 

Your example is stupid. Yes. "
8143,The fact that they are true makes them true
8144,"You're saying you are against the ""believe victims"" mentality, aren't you? Maybe I'm confused."
8145,You think my data showing white men commit thousands of hate crimes every year detracts from my point that white men commit thousands of hate crimes every year?
8146,"The second you set your neutral stance on something to ""believe victims"" you've already created a bias no matter the circumstance.  I would rather not voice my opinion on any person---alleged perpetrator OR victim--until facts come out.  That is my entire point.  I completely support the #MeToo movement, but by far the most misguided part of that movement is the introduction of the idea that every victim automatically deserves to be believed no matter what the story is.  Saying nothing until all the facts come out is far less damaging to every person involved and far more logical than saying from the outset that the alleged victim is 100% telling the truth.  "
8147,"Well, your point is basically that the majority of the people (white) commit the majority of the crimes. Nothing groundbreaking about that. Interestingly, stats do show that black people are overrepresented and commit a massive amount of hate crimes each year as well."
8148,"It's fine that you believe that. It's been the status quo for tens of thousands of years. It's worked out fine for men, for women not so much. And so we women will try and change that, at least for ourselves. You don't have to make that journey."
8149,"True. Many different kinds of people can be bad. But the high death count hate crimes are all committed by white men. The Wisconsin Sikh Temple shooting, the Emmanuel AME shooting, the Isla Vista shooting, the Yoga studio shooting in Florida, the Pittsburgh Synagogue massacre..."
8150,"So you won't believe a black man who tries to pull off a little hoax...

But you will believe a white man who tries to pull off a big hoax -- and who is famous for his lies.

Just checking."
8151,"> It's fine that you believe that. 

Again.  What I believe is literally the most logical approach to criminal justice.  Avoid judgement in the absence of facts...That has ""... *been the status quo for tens of thousands of years...*"" because it logically makes sense.  

To take your position and make your ""journey"" you are inherently admitting and encouraging to two pretty despicable things:

**1)** You are absolutely fine with collateral damage in all of this.  So, if someone is falsely accused you are perfectly fine with that.  It is more important to you to point the finger of guilt at someone than it is to point that finger at the right person.

**2)** Facts come second to public opinion when it comes to sexual assault of women (or men).

Victims deserve to be heard and they deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.  That is what they deserve.  They deserve to be believed when there are facts to support what they say and when the alleged assailant can be charged.  The moment you believe that every victim is telling the truth every time you are essentially saying you no longer believe in due process or justice for that matter.  I am a very liberal guy and even I will never agree with that part of the #MeToo movement.

What your are talking about is not a ""journey"" it is a de-evolution of justice.

There are examples of this in our not so distant history.  Black men were beaten and lynched for talking to or even looking at white women.  Lets remove the blatant disgusting racism from it for the sake of example.  Lets pretend that talking to or even looking at a white women was a legitimate crime at the time.  Do you believe there were never any innocent men who were beaten or lynched for that ""crime"" back in the day?  Do you believe there was never a white woman who was racist to her core that lied and said a black man spoke to her just because she had some grievance against him?  There is no conceivable reason why if that were around today I would agree that every one of those women deserve to be believed without facts to back it up.  

Today it is not lynching thank god, but the court of public opinion is pretty damaging to a persons reputation for the rest of their life.  I would rather get it right and get the true criminal than to just point my finger at someone for the sake of a movement."
8152,">So you won't believe a black man who tries to pull off a little hoax...

Why would I believe a hoax? As I've said before, anyone with half a brain knew it was total bullshit. It's not racist to call out blatant lies.

>But you will believe a white man who tries to pull off a big hoax -- and who is famous for his lies.

](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2019/01/16/tennessee-free-college-000867) , of all places, seems to have figured it out, I imagine the country can. The also seemed to have figured out that an educated workforce is much more useful for attracting businesses than corporate giveaways like Amazon and FoxConn are demanding.

Never thought I'd see Tennessee as a leader in good sense in education and economic policy, but there it is."
8154,"You know, I don’t quite understand why the system they have in Florida (Bright Futures) can’t be emulated elsewhere. Basically they have two levels: Level A you get 100% tuition and fees at a state school, Level B you get 75% of Tuition and fees at a state school.

The requirements for level A are 3.5+ GPA, 1290 or 29 on SAT or ACT, and 100 hours of community service (done over four years in high school). Level B is 3.0+, 1170 or 26, and 75 hours. But that’s it: everyone who meets these requirements and applies gets it, there’s no committee choosing among applicants and no needs based requirement. I think you have to use it within a year or two of graduating high school, and I believe the limit of funding stops at 5 years or so.

I realize there are some gaps to be filled for some underprivileged students, but for the most part this program ensures that if you have the drive and the desire to go to college, you can, which is a far cry from how things are currently."
8155,"So, I was in the Clinton camp before, and this actually puts Amy Klobuchar to the right of Hillary Clinton, since Clinton had a free college plan with means testing. It actually costs less than the Republican corporate tax cut.

Countries with free college like Germany don't shuttle all their kids through one education path and measure success by how far they get before they fail, they have a path to success for every kid.   That's the only way to make free college a reasonable policy.  Under our broken education system, free 4-year college would just shuttle money to wealthier white kids.

8193,"Exactly.  And furthermore, why are these assholes talking like it's the same healthcare and schools that rich people can afford?  That's not what anyone is talking about.   We want BASIC healthcare and public college covered!   Not premium health insurance and graduate college!  Cover the basics and it only boosts people's chances to generate more revenue. "
8194,"Something ironic I noted about the 2016 election was the message that Trump was delivering was just a variation of Obama's 2008 message of ""Hope and Change"". The ""Make America Great Again"" slogan was ripped from Reagan but the core of his campaign really centered around bringing about change because he wasn't cut from the same cloth as the politicians that are dragging their heels on beneficial changes i.e ""Drain the Swamp"" which sort of applied to both democrats and republicans particularly in the primary. I thought it was surprising clever and when pitted against Hillary's message of just continuing Obama's policies it appeared to be more resonant.

I think people do want to hear optimism, they want change from whatever circumstance they are in because life just kinda sucks across the board for a larger amount of people than we'd like to admit. 

I think the winning message is probably going to be another variation of the ""Hope and Change"" combined with bold ideas that can be distilled into bytes like ""Medicare for All"" or ""Anti Corruption Reform"". The bigger the idea and less detail you give the better. 

When you start talking about what you can't do then people are going to extrapolate that and think you can't do what they want, whatever that may be. On the flip side, when you start to get into the grit of how you want to accomplish your proposals people just tune out because you know, ""Who knew healthcare could be so complicated!"".      "

8282,"**20 Things Guilty People Do That Trump Does Daily**
  
1 DEFLECT BLAME.  
Criminals seek others who may have conducted themselves poorly in order to unload or distribute blame rightly assigned to them. Trump does this with ex-aides like Manafort, Flynn, and Papadopoulos, who he presents as little known by him and/or having gone rogue.
  
2 ALLEGE A CONSPIRACY.  
Criminals will claim a conspiracy as the cause of their problems. The most common conspiracy alleged is between witnesses or members of law enforcement. Trump repeatedly alleges that government officials and law enforcement officers conspired against him.  
  
3 COMPLAIN ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT.   
Criminals want to talk about the investigation itself, rather than what and who the investigation is investigating. Trump obsessively complains about aspects of the investigation against him that don't actually change the underlying evidence. 
  
4 TAMPER WITH WITNESSES.   
Criminals will often seek contact with known witnesses either to convince them not to testify, to change their story, to remain loyal to the defendant, or to intimidate them. Trump did this with Flynn, Yates, Comey, McCabe, Sessions, his son, and others.  
  
5 DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THEIR ACTIONS.   
Criminals eagerly discuss subjects beyond their pending case when doing so distracts from their criminal liability. Trump's war on ""fake news"" and unhinged tweetstorms distract attention from an investigation threatening to take him down.  
  
6 REFUSE TO ANSWER VALID QUESTIONS.   
Criminals refuse to discuss, sometimes even with a lawyer, inculpatory facts, whether things they said, decisions they made, or actions they took. Trump has successfully evaded answering even the most basic questions on what he knew and when.  
  
7 EXHIBIT FALSE CONFIDENCE.   
Criminals often assure allies and defenders that there's nothing to be found against them and they'll shortly be exonerated, even when nothing in the facts supports this view. Trump's wild claims that he'll soon be exonerated fall into this category.  

8 USE ""EVEN IF"" ARGUMENTS.  
Criminals often float self-aggrandizing hypotheticals in the form of bet-hedging: ""Even if I did X, it wouldn't be illegal, or I would've been justified..."" Trump does this most flagrantly when discussing whether he told Flynn to negotiate with Russia.  
  
9 PLAY DUMB.  
Criminals will claim to have no knowledge of things they obviously would have known about. Trump claims to have known absolutely nothing any of his aides (even his own sons) were doing with the Russians, a claim that strains credulity well past the breaking point.  
  
10 EXHIBIT UNUSUAL AGITATION.  
Criminals exhibit anger in response to warranted criminal accusations; in my own experience, innocent people react to false accusations with signs of confusion, fear, and depression. Trump has responded to Mueller with rage and false self-assurance.  

11 LEVELING NEW ACCUSATIONS OF IDENTICAL CONDUCT.  
Criminals accused of, say, assault will often level new claims (even unrelated ones) that someone else is guilty of assault. Trump regularly accuses people of the lying, cover-ups, and treasonous conduct he stands accused of now.  
  
12 OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE.  
Criminals will try to slow the investigation against them, including by refusing to speak or delaying speaking to investigators. Trump not only won't speak to investigators, he's tried to fire, get reassigned, or force into retirement those investigators.  
  
13 AVOID GIVING EVIDENCE UNDER OATH.   
Criminals are smart enough to know that they must never be placed under oath on the subject of their crimes. Trump, despite saying in the Rose Garden that he'd speak to Mueller under oath, has thus far refused to make good on that assurance.  
  
14 DENY SIMILAR PAST CONDUCT.  
Even though criminal defense attorneys have access to clients' criminal records, criminals often attempt to downplay or deny their criminal pasts. Trump has denied provable and known frauds, perjuries, and clandestine foreign contacts from his past.  
  
15 TELL UNNECESSARY, GRANDIOSE LIES.  
Criminals lie out of fear; they tell grandiose lies out of a false belief they can orchestrate their exoneration. Trump's lies about how he conducted himself at the Ritz Moscow in 2013 (grandiose and quickly disproven) are an example of this.  

16 DRAW OTHERS INTO THEIR COVER-UP.  
Criminals are so focused on their own survival that they needlessly draw innocents into their schemes for self-salvation. Trump uses others (including attorneys, spokespeople, aides, and family members) to spread lies about his Russian ties.  

17 TRUST ONLY FAMILY.  
Criminals, especially those who've participated in a conspiracy, necessarily operate within a small circle of trust. Trump has surrounded his business dealings with family members and attorneys to make it unlikely or impossible that anyone will rat him out.  
  
18 PLAY WITH LANGUAGE.  
Criminals know statutes are well-defined, so they get cute with language to seek out wiggle room in their criminal liability. Trump uses word games, misquotations, false definitions, and linguistic misdirection to undercut precise legal terms and concepts.  
  
19 SEEK DODGY ALLIES AND PARALLEL INVESTIGATIONS.  
Criminals recruit dodgy witnesses or pursue suspect lines of inquiry to evade probes whose just administration they know will catch them. Trump uses House allies, Fox News, and dodgy pals to build a wall of allies around himself.  

20 UNDERSCORE SUPPORTERS' AFFECTION.  
Criminals hope that, if they don't have the facts on their side, they can at least get others to say they're a good person. Trump pumps up supporters' adulation, praise, and encouragement at every turn to transform popularity into innocence.
  
(BONUS) DENY KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS.  
Criminals deny knowing people they believe they can credibly deny knowing, if knowing them would be inculpatory. Trump has done this with Papadopoulos, Sater, Page and many others who he definitely knows but who he fears Mueller has linked to him.

8283,"The 25th Amendment is right there in the Constitution, not sure what would be illegal about talking about whether it applies to a given situation.   

Now, if they were all having a secret meeting in a tower somewhere and planning to use the 25th in order to overthrow the President to get sanctions lifted off of Russia, or something like that, then Trump might be on to something."
8284,"I love how he morphs into legal/constitutional scholar whenever it serves his purposes. Like this or his efforts to rescind Obamas DACA protections. But then he goes on to say asinine shit like NBC/Saturday Night Live needs to be ""investigated"", because of...reasons.  I fail to believe even his supporters think he knows what he's talking about."
8285,Another way of saying that is “many top officials at the fbi have seen evidence to suggest that trump might be working against the United States.” 
8286,"""Disgraced,"" ""fiasco,"" ""loser,"" ""failing,"" ""disaster,"" ""low energy,"" ""fake,"" ""crooked"" ""sad""; no one can say trump doesn't internalize his own press. "
8287,How would enacting a part of the Constitution be an illegal act? That doesn't even make sense. It would be the very definition of legal. 
8288,Except it’s the 25th Amendment....so not illegal at all
8289,An act that's literally in the Constitution? Sounds like they should have pursued the 25th honestly... he can not come up with a true argument about anything.
8290,Whereas all of Trump's acts are *very* legal and *very* cool. /s
8291,well was the watergate Investigation illegal? Nope.
8292,"I would love to know the levels of illegal that trump has in mind.
1. Extremely illegal
2. Very illegal
3. Somewhat illegal
4. Illegal
5. A little bit illegal
6. Almost not illegal "

8300,Holy crap
8301,"""Trump sees wall in path to re-election""
-FTFY"
8302,"I mean.. No shit. 

His tax plan screwed a bunch of his base over, he didn't lock her up, coal is still a dying industry, and the tariff fight has not been ""very easy to win"" and North Korea still has missiles. The wall was his big promise. Its central to his whole political identity.  The day Trump says the wall isn't happening is the day his political momentum dies and perhaps that of the entire GOP."
8303,That wall will block his path. 
8304,It’s going to hurt him. I know the polling numbers show his base is behind him (for now) but if the economy falters (and it already is) I think 2020 could be like 1932 in terms of a landslide for the Democrats. 
8305,"See this big expensive waste of materials thing sitting there, occupying space where nobody wants it to be because it's dumb and doesn't do the job it's supposed to do? Don't ya just *love* it? **It's the greatest ever!**
      
A vote for *that thing* in 2020 is a vote for another Russian sponsored, country ruining attempt at building an equally rediculous wall to keep the scary brown people out!"
8306,"The biggest chance he has is if people dont vote. If you fall for interference by other countries or GOP crap and dont like the person running, or vote is split because others with no chance,  and theres always electoral/vote fraud,  then he will get in again. We HAVE to be UNITED for whoever wins the Dem primary if we want to save this country and our future for our kids."
8307,"But I thought most of the ""Wall"" was built already? /s"
8308,"After Ann Coulter's comment, I can say, this may not be the best path now. "
8309,"He needs to keep his base inline

8314,So he’s going to brag about the abject failure to deliver on his “we will build a Great Wall and Mexico will pay for it” campaign promise. 
8315,I see 4 walls containing an itty bitty room in Trump's future.
8316,What a delusional buffoon. In case we had any doubts. 
8317,"Not only will it reinvigorate the xenophobic base, but also the contractors who charge American tax payers ~$4,500 per LINEAR FOOT for the wall will be quite generous with campaign donations."
8318,Path to impeachment maybe
8319,"Yea, there is no path to re-election for Trump if he sticks to just these shitty policies with his base. His base is locked in, but independents are put off with his crazy policies. His tax cuts continue to piss people off at tax time and shutting down the government have not won him any new voters.

Republicans lost independents by 12 percentage points in the mid-terms. Trump has done nothing to reach out to voters past his base. His base alone isn't enough to win national elections.

&#x200B;"
8320,"he sees his shrine at which cult45 will worship. 

""I love the poorly educated"" "
8321,"So no national emergency, other than POTUS using his power for political gain."
8322,"He's trying to shift as much blame to the democrats as possible in the next two years. 

He's going to blame the courts for the wall not happening. 

He tried to blame the democrats for the budgeting and let the shutdown happened. If those government voters were Trump voters, they sure aren't going to be trump voter in this upcoming election. "
8323,"> he didn't lock her up

That's the understatement of the week, considering that a chorus of his acolytes chanting ""lock her up"" are now indicted/convicted/in prison."
8324,Whatever happened to repel and replace? The GOP had all three branches of government AND the supreme court but still couldn't push through any meaningful changes to healthcare.

* Trump was first compromised by the Russians back in the 80s in the days of the Soviet Union. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades. In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

* In 1984, David Bogatin — a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, Apr 30, 1992)

* Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

* Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

* Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).

* One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

* From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

* So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was living at Trump Tower.

* According to a Bloomberg investigation (March 16, 2017) into Trump World Tower, which broke ground in 1998, “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”

* Here is the most prominent example: In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.

* As an example of the Russian mob operating out of Trump Tower, in 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.

* It has been widely known for decades that Russia often used videotaped ""honey traps"" to compromise influential visitors. General Oleg Kalugin, former head of counterintelligence for the KGB, told Craig Unger (Author, ""House of Trump, House of Putin"") they probably did this with Trump during his visit to Russia in 1987--long before the events in the Steele dossier. ""I can't tell what is inside Trump's mind, but everyone who traveled to Russia knew this.""

* Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

* A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. The big white shoe law firms--Jones Day, for example-- represent powerful Russian oligarchs who have billions and billions of dollars. Much of this is legal even though it appears to have compromised huge parts of the GOP. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay.

* At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""

* Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”

* Trump's first wife, Ivana, was under surveillance by the STB, the Czech secret police, and they reported to the KGB. Ivana got out of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 70s which was not easy to do.

* Regarding the Steele dossier, while not everything in the dossier has been corroborated, some of it has and none of it has been disproven. Christopher Steele has a terrific reputation in the intelligence world. For reference, Jeb Bush's opposition research included paying a US based intelligence firm (GPS Fusion), who reached out to Steele. This same intelligence firm was later hired by Clinton during her campaign. All of this was above-board and verifiable.

* At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.

* We don't know who may be prosecuted with Deutsche Bank, but Russian money laundering is a huge part of this and how they compromised Trump. Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out. They own him."
8430,"All the senate investigation did was interview people. Nobody expected somebody to walk in to the senate and produce a copy of a written contract between Trump and Putin. What was expected is exactly what happened; people close to the Trump campaign lied about what happened and were caught doing it.

Also, wait for the report from the senate. If you've been following the story carefully, you already know that the only thing that it's going to say that's good for Trump is that they didn't find any direct evidence of conspiracy. The senate and Mueller's reports will likely lead to years and years of further investigations. Donald Trump and his businesses are currently the subject of 24 separate investigations."

You can't say Assad is a threat to the United States because he's a brutal dictator, all the while we support Saudi Arabia, a country well known worldwide for clear human rights violations.

Honestly, it reminds me of Mike Flynn's trips to Russia and how those those trips were organized and funded, but actually worse because Flynn was a civilian at the time, unlike Gabbard.

My point wasn't to defend America on every single decision, because I don't.

But I don't see how you can simultaneously accuse Americans of supporting Saudi Arabia — which Congress [voted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html) to stop supporting its war in Yemen this week, so *some* progress is being made — because it's a dictatorial and brutal regime and defend Gabbard's position on Assad.

I can see how people can see that, then see how she doesn't want to go through with regime change there, and link the two. But if you were to link them, it still doesn't explain why she's still willing to call him a dictator, something we call anyone we don't like.

I can accuse the the US of supporting saudi Arabia because historically, we have supported SA. Yes we finally voted to stop supporting the war in Yemen, years after the fact. But all we did was pull support. We still act as if they're a great ally. We shouldn't be supporting them AT ALL. Yet we defend them left and right, on BOTH sides of the aisle. SA is more of a threat to the US than Assad is, yet we don't condemn SA anywhere near as much as we condemn Assad.

Saying no to regime change in Syria isn't support for Assad. It's just saying no to regime change in Syria. Because what will happen long term? Assad is gone, we put in our own puppet, eventually puppet doesn't want us anymore, then we do it again. OR we get rid of Assad, power vacuum exists, shit gets WORSE in Syria as a power struggle takes place. 

We've seen BOTH of those scenarios happen in the past. And it didn't work out either times.

With regards to Gabbard, whatever. I'm not voting for her, and never planned on it. But me not supporting her doesn't mean I'm gonna shit on her for statements taken out of context, nor will I try to put words in her mouth. She's made it clear multiple times that she doesn't support Assad. Yet people still throw around ""BUT U SAED ASSUD IS NUH THRET TO US!!! ASSUD LUVR!!""

Someone can both be a dictator to his/her people but also not be a threat to us. Those aren't mutually exclusive ideas. The day we stop the regime change nonsense that's been a part of US foreign policy for decades is that the day the world will start to actually recover from the shit we have done to it. Central and South America, the middle East, Africa, all hot spots with horrible wars. And do enough digging, and you find that we are the ones perpetrating and instigating those wars, to then later use them as means to get more involved and screw it up further."

I have not seen an analysis on the net economic impact (not to mention the additional social impact of people getting priced out of living in the region) but with enough tax breaks it's possible for government to come out as a net loser, and could instead use that amount on other projects.  Of course, the net loss should not be the full tax break amount that Amazon would get, but it was a rhetorical point in the first place."

It's clear she doesn't understand what a tax break is. NY wasn't giving Amazon 3 billion,  they were just not taking 3 billion. I'll also say it's possible that she might have clarified her points and those weren't quoted but from this article it looks like she is more interested in being morally right and not factually right. 

While I have you I'll give you a little food for thought. There is no left or right, just corporatism. The more right leaning ideals of giving tax breaks to large corporations hurt small businesses, stifle competition and keeps the corporations as leaders. The left's ideals of high taxes do the same. Large corporations can burden these taxes while young and small businesses are choked out."

Supported a bill banning social networking by sex workers.

Harris was also a big booster of familial DNA searches, a controversial technique whereby investigators compare a DNA sample to other samples in a DNA database to find possible relatives, then use additional genetic testing and analysis to confirm the match, all in order to solve crimes. Due to privacy concerns, the technique hasn’t been adopted in Canada, and was outlawed in both Maryland and DC. Among the concerns are the not-infrequent cases of human error in DNA evidence, the fact that familial testing would disproportionately impact communities of color, the potential revelation of family secrets, and the already existing instances of mistakes being made with the technique.

Harris was likewise a firm proponent of civil asset forfeiture, sponsoring a bill to allow prosecutors to seize profits before charges were even filed. Years before that, she opposed AB 639, a bill that aimed to reform asset forfeiture. The bill easily cleared the state assembly, but was soon scuttled by a united wall of opposition from law enforcement, with whom Harris was united.

8728,"**Non-Binary Defined**


Most people – including most transgender people – are either male or female. But some people don't neatly fit into the categories of ""man"" or ""woman,"" or “male” or “female.” For example, some people have a gender that blends elements of being a man or a woman, or a gender that is different than either male or female. Some people don't identify with any gender. Some people's gender changes over time.
People whose gender is not male or female use many different terms to describe themselves, with non-binary being one of the most common. Other terms

 include **genderqueer, agender, bigender,** and more. None of these terms mean exactly the same thing – but all speak to an experience of gender that is not simply male or female.




**Why “Non-Binary”?**

Some societies – like ours – tend to recognize just two genders, male and female. The idea that there are only two genders is sometimes called a “gender binary,” because binary means “having two parts” (male and female). Therefore, “non-binary” is one term people use to describe genders that don’t fall into one of these two categories, male or female.


**Basic Facts about Non-Binary People**

**Non-binary people are nothing new.** Non-binary people aren’t confused about their gender identity or following a new fad – non-binary identities have been recognized for millennia by cultures and societies around the world.

**Some, but not all, non-binary people undergo medical procedures to make their bodies more congruent with their gender identity.** While not all non-binary people need medical care to live a fulfilling life, it’s critical and even life-saving for many.
Most transgender people are not non-binary. While some transgender people are non-binary, most transgender people have a gender identity that is either male or female, and should be treated like any other man or woman.


**Being non-binary is not the same thing as being intersex.** Intersex people have anatomy or genes that don’t fit typical definitions of male and female. Most intersex people identify as either men or women. Non-binary people are usually not intersex: they’re usually born with bodies that may fit typical definitions of male and female, but their innate gender identity is something other than male or female.


**You don’t have to understand what it means for someone to be non-binary to respect them.** Some people haven’t heard a lot about non-binary genders or have trouble understanding them, and that’s okay. But identities that some people don’t understand still deserve respect.

Genuine question. What's the difference between having ""a gender that blends elements of being a man or a woman"" and just being someone who doesn't fit traditional gender norms.

8781,"""Non-Binary"" would probably be the best option for if we were to just go for a base one that would encompass a lot of those that would benefit from a gender classification that more accurately represents them. There are a lot of different classifications and terminologies out there, but I feel that would be a good start (accompanied with actually allowing individuals easier ability to alter what their assigned gender is legally, which is a problem many trans people face after transition.)"
8782,But the issue is crossing physiological and psychological attributes.
8783,"No, gender on ID is probably one of the top ten pressing state centered material issues for transgender people in the United States. (Healthcare is probably #1 (because transition is expensive!), criminal justice reform #2 (Because cops love to arrest us and then call us sex workers, and plenty of us are forced into sex work by economic realities) and ENDA style stuff #3, but after that I think it's probably identification)

The government cares about your gender, not your sex. Most states have a method of changing your gender on your ID, I think all of them might. It certainly calls it's columns sex, but let's be clear, it fills that column with gender data.

That much is very important: It is not uncommon for people to see a name and a gender on an ID and treat someone with more scrutiny if it doesn't match their expectations. To be quite frank, it is dangerous to carry on your person that does not match your gender identification, and it can be dangerous to carry one that does. 

Education is almost nothing. It is a black hole into which effort goes, but hardly escapes. It is better than nothing, but it is almost nothing. People who know more are made more capable of doing harm just as much as they are made willing to do less.

If the census continued to maintain a gender (or sex) column, I would have no problem with that. Then again, a census is anonymized, so I'd still say that the government at least has no interest in *individual* genders.

As it is currently, it is possible to petition to have your birth certificate changed to reflect your transition, which takes pretty much all of the teeth out of bathroom bills.... I mean, it isn't necessarily easy, and that can be improved, but the proposed system might have unintended consequences."
8796,"> No, gender on ID is probably one of the top ten pressing state centered material issues for transgender people in the United States.

You kinda proved my point... there's more at stake here for trans people than bureaucracy. Not tracking gender is a possible solution, though as I said it might have implications for census and statistics and whatnot. It would, however, deal with the problem of reinforcing the male/female binary if only implicitly.

What is even the point of gender on ID? If trans issues have thought me something is that gender is something that is deeply within one's mind/personality, and as such there is no usefulness to having it as an outward identifier. I mean, having eye colour or something could be useful, because it can be verified and be seen to match or not with the ID you're presenting, but how would you really know that someone's gender is X/Y/Z? Why would anyone care? Do I get a free pass for ladies' night if it has an F there?

If education is a black hole, then all of this is pointless though. Might as well just resign to the dark ages of gender enlightenment. Come on! You can't deny that the younger generations are leaps ahead of what the general population was decades ago. Some of my favourite youtubers are actually (to my surprise) NB, agender, trans or some other kind of queer. I've been able to learn and (*most importantly*) empathized with their experiences. I might've even furthered my questioning and deconstruction of my own gender identity and the assumptions we often make about it. This gets passed along to people I know, even if I'm not specifically pushing it in their faces.

It's not knowing itself that changes the world. It's pushing for an empathic approach that actually tries to understand where other people are coming from that transforms society. For example, at one time all hollywood references to queerness were quelled, or it was made to paint it in a bad light. Granted, queer representation still sucks, but at least you can have art or documentaries that foment your understanding and empathy of their struggles, rather than simply demonizing them. This could be a marginal effect on the whole, *but it's something*.

The idiots and reactionaries are usually the most vocal, though. That's always going to happen, but is no reason to ignore educating humanity. Not to say that institutional recognition can't go a long ways, but just like gay marriage: shouldn't the objective be to dismantle the oppressive gender norms rather than assimilate into the current structure by the force of the law? Because slightly changing the law won't change the fundamental problems that were causing the oppression, nor does it necessarily change the minds of those reactionaries and people in the ""middle"" who aren't a hopeless cause."

8817,"Because their worldview is predicated on the idea that there is a ""proper"" way for things to be. Whether it's gender norms or not eating pork, religion and tradition try to suppress what they can't control and contradicts or challenges their narrow views. When absolutely necessary they will assimilate it or adapt their own standards, but that's a last resort. The mere existence of people who don't conform to how they say the world should be is a threat. Since their views conflict with reality that happens a lot, so they're insecure all the fucking time"

The list of indictments, with pleas & convictions, [courtesy of Vox.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury)

The full list of known indictments and plea deals in Mueller’s probe

1) George Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, was arrested in July 2017 and pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. He got a 14-day sentence.

2) Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, was indicted on a total of 25 different counts by Mueller’s team, related mainly to his past work for Ukrainian politicians and his finances. He had two trials scheduled, and the first ended in a conviction on eight counts of financial crimes. To avert the second trial, Manafort struck a plea deal with Mueller in September 2018 (though Mueller’s team said in November that he breached that agreement by lying to them).

3) Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and Manafort’s longtime junior business partner, was indicted on similar charges to Manafort. But in February 2018 he agreed to a plea deal with Mueller’s team, pleading guilty to just one false statements charge and one conspiracy charge.

4) Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI.

5-20) 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies were indicted on conspiracy charges, with some also being accused of identity theft. The charges related to a Russian propaganda effort designed to interfere with the 2016 campaign. The companies involved are the Internet Research Agency, often described as a “Russian troll farm,” and two other companies that helped finance it. The Russian nationals indicted include 12 of the agency’s employees and its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

21) Richard Pinedo: This California man pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge in connection with the Russian indictments, and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller. He was sentenced to 6 months in prison and 6 months of home detention in October 2018.

22) Alex van der Zwaan: This London lawyer pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Rick Gates and another unnamed person based in Ukraine. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and has completed his sentence.

23) Konstantin Kilimnik: This longtime business associate of Manafort and Gates, who’s currently based in Russia, was charged alongside Manafort with attempting to obstruct justice by tampering with witnesses in Manafort’s pending case last year.

24-35) 12 Russian GRU officers: These officers of Russia’s military intelligence service were charged with crimes related to the hacking and leaking of leading Democrats’ emails in 2016.

36) Michael Cohen: In August 2018, Trump’s former lawyer pleaded guilty to 8 counts — tax and bank charges, related to his finances and taxi business, and campaign finance violations — related to hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Donald Trump, as part of a separate investigation in New York (that Mueller had handed off). But in November, he made a plea deal with Mueller too, for lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

37) Roger Stone: In January 2019, Mueller indicted longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone on 7 counts. He accused Stone of lying to the House Intelligence Committee about his efforts to get in touch with WikiLeaks during the campaign, and tampering with a witness who could have debunked his story.

Finally, there is one other person Mueller initially investigated, but handed over to others in the Justice Department to charge: Sam Patten. This Republican operative and lobbyist pleaded guilty to not registering as a foreign agent with his work for Ukrainian political bigwigs, and agreed to cooperate with the government."

8955,"Unfortunately,  it's not a confession."
8956,Whoa there slappy...I thought no clapping for you enthusiastically enough at the SOTU was treason?  Now the FBI?  
8957,Trumps reason is treason
8958,"He thinks that by normalizing the word in his tweets, it'll be less damaging when the charges are laid. So he'll be tweeting it a lot in the next little while. Get us used to the idea. Normalize it. Nothing to see here folks. Just a little of that treason stuff. "

8969,It’s treason then.
8970,"He thinks criticizing him is treason and that discussing the 25th amendment is too.  Instead of being adult and trying to assure voters that he is not incapable of office, he goes off on paranoid rants."

9051,"Copying a previous comment so I don’t have to retype:

Since the mainstream media doesn't like to look at issues for the complexities that they are, let's really understand the Amazon issue. As a resident of the DC metro, we've been having some really great discussions about the impact of Amazon on National Lan...fuck that...it's Crystal City.

Amazon is not talking about building a warehouse or distribution site that would encourage high paying/low education jobs needed. These are high tech, white collar, high education/extreme high pay jobs. While that sounds great on the surface, does a highly socially stratified area like NYC or DC REALLY need more elite jobs that would only further push the working poor into absolute poverty, put gentrification on even more steroids, and make housing even more a dream for the middle class?

I don't even live in NoVa but Amazon talk has already bled into my neighborhood on the other side of the Potomac as raising my property tax and raising already insane rents/housing costs. We already have a housing shortage crisis just like NYC and this just threw gas on a four alarm fire.

I was really hoping Amazon would have gone to an area like Pittsburgh which has the technology infrastructure but not the out of control gentrification like NYC or DC.

Stop making this issue as black and white as we are. Not all ""job creators"" are good for areas."
9052,"Because ""middle america"" is chock full of workers that can design AWS networks, or develop AI learning algorithms, just waiting around for jobs to come to them?"
9053,"Wanting a massive international company to pay taxes because regular people have to pay taxes is a ""populist sledgehammer""? It seems pretty meek to me. "
9054,"When everyone was trying to ""woo"" Amazon, I can't believe they didn't come to Nebraska for some Omaha Steaks gift packages. 

I mean there's so much land here they could have built their own city. 

But nah, not cool enough, I understand. "
9055,"I'm sure ""Middle America"" would love to pay the extortion fee for Amazon jobs, unfortunately, years of decimating education does not make for an educated work force. "
9056,"But Amazon doesn't want to move to middle America.

They want to be in DC where they can lobby lawmakers, and New York where they can get financial expertise, and the west coast where they get the tech expertise."
9057,"I'm pretty sure these people are a lot happier that they saved 3 billion dollars in taxes for their state, and now they aren't going to be priced out of where they live due to skyrocketing rental costs.

But keep fucking that chicken"
9058,"They're interviewing the mayor of youngstown, ohio

i'm sure he's a nice man

but other than an attempt to paint the leaders of nyc and ms aoc as utterly wrong 

or to further drive a wedge between real america and those evil coastal elites

not sure what the point of interviewing him is


of course a small town mayor in a dying poor community would love amazon to be there

amazon has no use for them however 

we're talking jobs that few of us are capable of doing

and the few that can likely have no interest in moving to a small dying poor town 

"
9059,"These folks are desperate to pin this on some “uppity” politician when it was 100% Amazon running away from a pro-Union state.

AOC was right, as usual."
9060,Send them to middle America then?
9061,lol clutching those pearls
9062,then take them to middle america. 
9063,No one needs amazon's jobs. Amazon needs to fuck off and create a labor friendly business model. 
9064,"Middle America is the only people that would’ve gotten those jobs anyway.

Then even more assholes from middle America would move to NY for their new Amazon job.

Give a 3 billion tax cut to local, small businesses instead, so REAL New Yorkers can have an opportunity at employment that won’t evaporate in a year or two."
9065,Birmingham Alabama would have been a better place for them to expand.  We already have much of the infrastructure that Amazon was demanding and have plenty of areas where high end housing could be built without causing a lot of middle/lower class people to be priced out of their neighborhoods.  The only demand that Amazon made that Birmingham was unable to meet was our airport doesn't currently have daily direct flights to New York and Washington DC.
9066,"I'm also a DC resident (Navy Yard) and I already pay out the ass for a 400 sq ft apartment, and I don't need Amazon over in Crystal City raising the prices of nearly everything. We already pay enough. The gentrification down in my area of DC has obviously been unreal and slowly pushing everyone across the river. My skyline right now has 11(!) cranes for new condos and apartments going up, meanwhile there are like 2 strips of genuine neighborhood left. 

I completely agree with everything you said, it's not a black and white issue. "
9067,"Agree on all points, and thank you for calling it Crystal City. "
9068,Almost stopped reading at “msm” since that is a partisan term.  I do agree with not needing more jobs in the already over gentrified areas. 
9069,"> Amazon is not talking about building a warehouse or distribution site that would encourage high paying/low education jobs needed

Also let's not forget the abuse Amazon puts those warehouse/distribution center workers through. I know several people employed at one, and it's just misery"
9070,"This is spot on. I was so happy when RTP wasn’t chosen. Things aren’t as dire here as they are in NYC or DC, but it’s already heading that way. Did not need that extra push."
9071,I'm glad they've said they're going to Nashville instead. Nashville can certainly use that headquarters a *lot* more than LIC can. We're all full up in here.
9072,"I agree with what you are saying, however, the people whose employment you are worried about; the low-skill/unskilled (I don't use that term with any disrespect) low-education lower class working poor are not going to gain any jobs or any prospects from this decision either. In fact with the surge of automation we are about experience over the next two decades their prospects are going to be be much more bleak as the jobs we traditional think of as ""low skilled"" are going to be the first and hardest hit. It's going to be a lot worse than most people realize. 

So really all this does is remove a bunch of white collar jobs that could have at least been taxed. The efficiency of how they would have taxed and where that money goes is of course another issue. At best you could make the argument this will slow down the rise of rent/housing costs. But for a half dozen regions in the world I don't think anything is going to do that, and NY is one of them. 

The end result is a bunch of jobs, admittedly white collar IT jobs, that would have existed in the area don't exist and end up somewhere else. The prospects of the low-education/low-skilled workers continue to get worse and will continue to get worse at a steadily increasing rate. And rent and housing costs continue to go up, at best at a slightly slower rate than they would have if the project would have gone ahead.  

"
9073,"This past week I saw a lot of some pundit lady on MSNBC  advocating the 25K jobs Amazon could have put in Queens and she was boasting about how they would be high tech, good paying jobs.    

Sounded to me like she didn't have her facts straight or was just lying.    No Amazon hub is ever going to have 25K high tech, high paying jobs.    That's fantasy land."
9074,I get that income inequality is a problem.  The solution however is not anti-intellectualism.  The populist left and populist right are destroying this country.  The way to get back to normalcy is embracing politicians who will lift the working class up without interfering with the machinery of capitalism.  AOC is just as bad for America as McConnell.
9075,And nobody that does those things want to move to Gary Indiana.
9076,They would had Republicans not been gutting their local education systems while preventing a coherent  national education strategy since the 1980's.
9077,"> They want to be in DC where they can ~~lobby lawmakers~~ get tech expertise, and New York where they can get ~~financial~~ tech expertise, and the west coast where they get the tech expertise. 

FTFY. All of those areas have deep pools of tech talent, most of whom aren't at all interested in relocating to Seattle. Ease of staffing in these other areas will also make Amazon less dependent on Seattle and more able to threaten to leave if the Seattle city council doesn't do their bidding."
9078,We didn't save anything. We lost on 30 billion in tax revenue. The $3 b was a rebate on the expected $30 b in tax revenue. 
9079,"Youngstown is the kind of place where the Jewish kids go to Catholic school.

9083,"I worked security at a few. They treat the workers like slaves, and routinely violate labor law as a matter of course. "
9084,Y'all's infrastructure would never catch up. 
9085,"They absolutely gain when yet another social stratifying variable is taken out of the equation 

Amazon would have driven rents and cost of living again through the roof- displacing the few working poor who are still able to live in areas like Queens 

In the gentrification formula, no growth can absolutely benefit the poor"
9086,Bullshit. Centrism is what created this mess. 
9087,"Trust in the ""invisible hand"" is what's been eroding benefits and wages and creating another gilded age. Not saying AOC's policy is necessarily THE solution but the answer is absolutely not centrism"
9088,"Yeah, name one thing AOC has done that compares to blocking a Merrick Garland vote? McConnell has done tons of other stuff as well with the extreme power he wields. But we can start with one of his most egregious actions. "
9089,but we need those people to move to those places and revitalize them. 
9090,Average income is 50k there. They're definitely saved from being forced out.

9093,"It's going to happen anyway, is what I'm saying, all this will do is slow it down a little and the spike won't be as sudden. It will happen piecemeal at a slower rate. That's all. "
9094," No, extremism did.  AOC and her cult of personality worshippers are part of the problem."
9095,"Democratic Centrism is not in trusting “the invisible hand”.  It’s about making capitalism work for everyone through progressive taxation, strong regulations, and programs to help the poor.  What it is not about is waging war on companies that would bring thousands of 6-figure jobs to communities that desperately need the property and local taxes."
9096,"True. And that's where subsidies and incentives *should* be used. But any such agreements should include severe penalties if the company being wooed ends up reneging on its promises/claims (looking at you, Foxconn)."
9097,Why? Who wants to sacrifice their lives to revitalize the midwest? There's no holy mandate that every square inch of land be inhabited. 
9098,"That's great, but the situation we are in now, where any city in the country is willing to roll out the red carpet of tax breaks, there can be no way for that to work.  "
9099,"And why would those workers move to Bumshart, Nebrahoma to be surrounded by uneducated, poor, Republican welfare queens  instead of an actual city with things to do and people to associate with?

I get that the problem is hard, but this is why suburban sprawl is a thing. Having grown up around the kind of places you're talking about, there's a reason I got out as fast as I possibly could and got a real job and a serious career. ""Send the engineers back,"" is all well and good, but the schools are shit, the  infrastructure is non-existent, and the people are, frankly, nowhere near ready to understand they've been straight up swindled for 3 or 4 generations. "
9100,"No, that's what those places need. We need to concentrate industries in certain areas like Silicon Valley, or Shenzen."
9101,"And if that were the case, they don't get any money back. 

This really isn't that complicated. If Amazon doesn't meet thresholds, they don't get the tax incentive."

The more extreme parts of the party are important to rouse the public against corporate influence in policy. Do you think a centrist like Kamala Harris would support single-payer without the Bernies and AOCs rallying for it? "
9106,to make them more liberal :) Long game. lol
9107,"it can, if the company isn't looking at that as the main reason for the move. "
9108,"well, a good paying job, cheaper housing (and new b/c they would have to build) it would bring lots of money in. Why did people go live in the middle of nowhere in unsavory conditions ever? Oil, good land, etc. Same here. I am not saying they should definitely have left Queens (it was Queens right?) but I do get the argument that it would drive housing costs up. Like SF. Sometimes there is too much of a good thing. I grew up in those places too. I understand what you are saying but that is how progress is made. 

I guess it is our thinking though. The here and now versus the future. "
9109,"Why? So they can become like SF? don't get me wrong, I love SF but it has some problems and the cost of living is ridiculous. it's not like saying, move everything out, just that when you are ready to expand, might be good to look at areas that might be a little underrated and where the expansion would not just help the people that would have to be imported to do the jobs, but the local people who will provide services to those folks. To me, that is the real meaning of a rising tide lifts all boats. "
9110,"And....that would be relevant how?



 "
9111,"Its kind of hard for the Democratic Party to push for the sort of platform of FDR given the current composition of the legislature.  Lets look at where the Democratic Party stood in 1934 when the New Deal was passed:

**72nd US Congress**

House of Representatives:

Democratic Party: 256

Democratic Farm-Labor Party: 1

Republican Party: 178

United States Senate:

Democratic Party: 59

Democratic Farm-Labor Party: 1

Republican Party: 36

Democrats had a filibuster proof majority in the Senate and a massive majority in the House.  You label centrists as being ""Republican-lite"" but the truth is that Hillary Clinton arguably had the most progressive platform in decades.  If you let centrists in competitive districts do their thing and win elections and Democrats get back to 60+ Senators, it is at that point that you will see real progressive legislation again enacted."
9112,At the expense of millions of people's happiness? Give me a break.
9113,"Because we need highly efficient, tightly integrated industries to remain competitive.  Like ""Made in China 2025"" or Germany's ""Industry 4.0"". We can't rely on momentum alone to keep us going.

If you want your boat to rise with the tide, get out of the lake, and come to the ocean.

Or build some hyperloops. Proximity is relative to speed after all."
9114,Hmmm...I’m gonna let you figure that one out
9115,"what? No, there are plenty of people who would be interested to move to an area with lower cost of living. They don't now b/c there aren't good jobs in those areas. Only myopic folks who can't see that the area will change dramatically with that kind of investment would be so unwilling to move and I doubt those are the types of employees companies like Amazon and Google are looking for anyway. There will be demand for the same kind of things that they have in the cities now and those things would pop up quickly. They would have the ability to save more instead of having so much of their salary go to housing. They could travel. etc. I think you underestimate how many people would be willing to move under such circumstances. "
9116,I don't feel like we are talking about the same thing. I don't understand how what you are saying contradicts in any way with what I am saying. 
9117,Thought so....
9118,You can't tightly integrate geographically disparate industries.
9119,why not? 
9120,For the same reason I can't smack you right now. You're in another fucking state.
9121,"Lindsey, do yourself and this nation a favor and reveal whatever it is ""they"" have on you."
9122,There was an *actual* coup. In 2016. By Russia and Individual-1
9123,Why even have the 25th amendment if it’s going to be considered a coup? ^rhetorical ^question
9124,"Only one side is scared of this being investigated thoroughly and it's not Dems. Bring it on, Lindsey"
9125,"Just because it *might* be a ""coup"" doesn't make illegal or wrong. The 25th amendment provides the proper means for a neccesary ""coup"", IMO."
9126,Somebody knows his hands are dirty and is trying to protect himself. 
9127,How long until Republicans claim that because of all these “attacks” on their dear leader we need to suspend the next presidential election?
9128,"The 25th Amendment is designed to remove a president unfit for office, this may be news to you, but this president is unfit for office."

9135,So much projection isn’t not even funny anymore.

9137,Senator Graham? The ghost of John McCain would like a word.....
9138,This level of projection by the republicans in fucking amazing.

9143,"Either Republicans in the FBI and possibly the cabinet were involved in a coup attempt, or there were valid reasons for the 25th amendment to be considered.

Democrats should come out and publicly support Graham's call for this Senate investigation.
"
9144,I think there is a decent chance that Russians hacked his Grindr account. 
9145,Exactly. People are allowed to discuss every other amendment right?
9146,They might end up married because spouses can't testify against each other.
9147,"It’d be good to know more about this, but we all know Graham’s Senate investigation will be a sham and any damning testimony towards Trump will be hidden. It’s been that way for two years."
9148,"Invocation of the 25th Amendment is explicitly lawful: it's right there in the Constitution.

Lawful transfer of power according to the laws and constitution of the Republic is not a coup. "
9149,"Why dance to this fancy man's tune?  The Senate Repubs are not backing him, btw, which is telling.

What is scary enough to have turned old Linds from Trump critic to his biggest supporter after McConnell?"
9150,"The rumor (and honestly who knows if its true or who is pushing it) is that its not grindr, its that he has a super damaging fetish. The fetish I heard, (again, rumor, so MAJORLY take this with a grain of salt) is that he likes dressing up as a baby. (again, this could just be to damage him, or divide us)."
9151,"Exactly, I'm sure people wouldn't be too happy if every time someone discussed their 2nd amendment rights, they get sent away for attempted murder."
9152,"> we all know Graham’s Senate investigation will be a sham and any damning testimony towards Trump will be hidden

In which case the focus will be on a Republican bureaucratic coup attempt as Graham charges. I say let them have at it!"

It's for the person, persons, or organization which has ""done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.""

Lol fuck off dailyliar. The only link CAIR has to Hamas today is that they're both ostensibly Muslim orgs. "
9454,Right-wing news sites and actively pushing fake narratives to divide political opponents - name a more iconic duo.
9455," 

#### Internet Disinformation #1: CAIR is ""the Wahhabi lobby,"" a ""front-group for Hamas,"" a ""fund-raising arm for Hezbollah,"" or ""...part of a wider conspiracy overseen by the Muslim Brotherhood. ...""

CAIR was born out of a desire on the part of its founders to ""concentrate on combating anti-Muslim discrimination nationwide."" The organization's advocacy model -- work closely with media and provide direct services to local Muslim communities -- was developed when Nihad Awad and Ibrahim Hooper worked as community activists.

In a March 14, 2007 *New York Times* article, Michael Rolince, a retired F.B.I. official who directed counterterrorism in the Washington field office from 2002 to 2005, said, ""Of all the groups, there is probably more suspicion about CAIR, but when you ask people for cold hard facts, you get blank stares.""

The article also reported, ""Government officials in Washington said they were not aware of any criminal investigation of the group. More than one described the standards used by critics to link CAIR to terrorism as akin to McCarthyism, essentially guilt by association.""

CAIR is not is ""the Wahhabi lobby,"" a ""front-group for Hamas,"" a ""fund-raising arm for Hezbollah,"" ""...part of a wider conspiracy overseen by the Muslim Brotherhood..."" or any of the other false and misleading associations our detractors seek to smear us with. That we stand accused of being both a ""fundraising arm of Hezbollah"" and the ""Wahhabi lobby"" is a significant point in demonstrating that our detractors are hurling slander not fact. Hezbollah and the Salafi (Wahhabi) movement represent diametrically opposed ideologies.

CAIR's origin story is simple. In the February-March 2000 edition of ""The Link,"" a newsletter published by Americans for Middle East Understanding, Nihad Awad wrote the following, ""The core challenge \[to American Muslims\], that of stereotyping and defamation, was having a devastating effect on our children and paralyzing adults from taking their due roles in civic affairs."" Based on a desire to address this issue on a national level, Awad, ""contacted my friend Ibrahim Hooper, a professional journalist and communications genius, and tried to persuade him to move to Washington and join the project.""

With this premise in mind, CAIR was founded in 1994.

Everything presented is extremely tenuous, like every source linking CAIR to Hamas being dated from before it was designated a terrorist org, or kinda random, like the UAE labeling CAIR a terrorirst org without explanation. Even the supposed link to the Holy Land Foundation  in 2007, where a judge labeled CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in financing terrorists activities, the judge himself admitted the prosecutors didn't really make their case, but refused to reverse his ruling."

9475,">""We have over 300 metric tons of food and medicine ready to deliver to the suffering people inside Venezuela. #MaduroCrimeFamily is doing everything they can to keep this from reaching their own people. This is pure evil,"" Rubio tweeted from inside the warehouse, surrounded by bags of USAID supplies.

Hey Marco, how does Puerto Rico look these days?"
9476,From what I heard on The Daily podcast the borders are still open and goods are going in and out of the country. The shipment of food and medicine sent by the US is being used by both sides as political tool to drive their agenda. 
9477,Isnt it weird that all these people are focused on Venezueala when an honest to God Genocide is going on in a right wing country in south east Asia and nobody bats an eye?
9478,"If the U.S. is going to go in, need a coalition of South American countries to give the effort legitimacy. Don't see an end to this so long as the army is still loyal to Maduro."
9479,Myanmar/Burma?
9480,Yep.
9481,"I'd imagine some of it (from an Americancentric point of view) is that not that many people even know Myanmar is a country or where it is located on the map. Sure, some of them would probably also have an issue pointing out Venezuela, but they at least know it's vaguely South American-ish. 

But more to the point right now, it's easy for certain groups to point to Venezuela and say ""Oh socialism is bad"" and refugees fleeing the country may come here (true or not as the largest portion seems to be fleeing into Colombia). People like Trump and Rubio here can beat their xenophobic drums without getting into how the country ended up like that to begin with (corruption, other countries getting involved, history). 

It's also easier to palate. And I've noticed this a lot when it comes to just Trump corruption. It's easy to say ""oh this is bad"" and still internally justify it than, say, caging babies where the reaction is to simply turn your head and ignore it altogether. 

To the point, it's easy to point to Venezuela's collapsing economy and assign blame or big picture it. It's easy to ignore the people directly affected, displaced, lost or killed, and because it's just kind of a big clusterfuck right now. But genocide though. That evokes a reaction. And given the opportunity human nature will turn someone away from that. It's hard to fit narrative into, it certainly doesn't do wonders for ratings. People simply don't want to acknowledge that that is going on if they can help it.

It's incredibly fucked up, and I'm guessing I'm preaching to the choir since you were the one to bring it up. But that would be my take on it. "
9482,"But it is telling that when it comes to South America, we literally only overthrow governments when they are leftist and never when they are  right wing."
9483,"That *does* seem to be the case. Going back to Nicaragua during the Reagan (Iran Contra affair) era, he was concerned that an actively left leaning government would be bad for the region, and thus backed the contras. There are dozens more examples where the US helped back certain leaders and helped destabilize the region. I don't think I'd ever actually gone through to look at who really profited in places like Brazil (replacing Goulart), Panama (all the Noriega stuff), Peru (under W), and the like. 

Although going through history, there does seem to be the precedent to prop up dictators who will allow better corporate or private interest access then those that are more interested in their own country's welfare. Or in cases like Noriega, simply being a useful asset to the CIA and helping keep down leftist revolutions in the area. 

That was an... interesting walk through history. Some I remembered or knew about, others like Brazil, I did not. "
9484,How is Netanyahu not in prison?
9485,This is behind a paywall.

9493,No
9494,"Feels like the landscape has changed since a year, or even six months ago. Before it felt inevitable and now it almost feels like-what’s the point? I don’t hate Biden like some do, but I’m not sure he’s the right person for this moment"
9495,"Whoever runs, runs.

Whoever wins the nomination, runs again.

Let the votes decide."
9496,"I like Bernie, but I supported Hillary. I love Obama and I love Biden. Now that Bernie has entered, I think Joe should enjoy relaxing. Just my humble opinion."
9497,"Now that Bernie has annoinced, yeah. It would be weird. The biggest thing holding him back was age. Now that the other old white guy has entered the arena there isn't much keeping Biden out."
9498,"No, don't run"
9499,"If Biden doesn’t run, this is Bernie’s nomination"
9500,I think he would have a good chance but his age is a concern. 
9501,Only people who want Biden to run is the media.
9502,"I now understand the difference between Reddit and the general electorate... Biden is incredibly strong. He is number one pick in every poll that includes him. He trounces Trump in head to head polls, where other candidates are polling in the margin of error. He's a known entity. He is popular with older folks, black people, but he's not sexy and far left, so Reddit doesn't even care. He is by far the front runner and Reddit is completely ignoring him. Huh."
9503,If he runs it would kindly dispel the ability for.  corporatist dems to make the argument that Bernie is “too old” 
9504,You can't run when you are paralyzed by indecision.
9505,Nope.
9506,Not really.  
9507,"Not even a little bit, for fuck's sake."
9508,"I like Biden, and I like Bernie. I think neither should run.

A younger perspective right about now wouldn't hurt. Yes, the younger candidates may be more prone to foot-in-mouth disease, but IMO the energy they bring to the race more than compensates for a stumble or two from inexperience.

9514,"I don’t hate the feller. If he’s able to stand out and cut through the formidable opposition he would face in the primary, more power to him. I’d vote for a mechanical pencil with no lead against Trump. Doesn’t hurt that we have qualified Dems running."
9515,"His meme value is ""old, bland, and useless.""  The only people that like him are the DNC, and I dread that they will pull their shenanigans again to try and favor him as the next candidate.  He'll be another Hillary campaign.  No one on the right would vote for him, he *might* pull some moderates, but the progressive wave happening would split off again and go for a more leftist third party, and that is Trump's road to another 4 years."

Using a more common phrase for it, public perception is a pretty large part of choosing a candidate if you actually care about them winning instead of just being a platform for raising awareness/discussion on specific issues.

9537,"It should be. The presidency is a difficult job, and the chances of Bernie or Biden mentally declining or having health issues is obviously higher than it would be for a younger candidate. Considering that candidates should ideally be seeking to serve 8 years, I can't see why age shouldn't be a factor. "

9545,"Yeah, we plan on lifting Americans out of poverty & increase quality of life by taking it from the greedy ultra-rich fucks :)"

9560,"Oh, I had forgotten about him.. *Yawn*"
9561,"Schultz will have the best shot at winning out of any 3rd party candidate in history. Dems have been stooping lower and lower this year and are becoming more radical than anything we've seen on the right. People are sick of it and will listen to Schultz and vote for him, mark my words"

9636,"Yeah but this bill added 150 billion the deficit each year for ten years, bringing the total increase in debt to 1.5 trillion (1.1 if you use dynamic scoring). 

Deficits were going to hit 1 trillion anyways due to entitlement spending growth. Seriousky, the CBO has super in depth projections. Does my inner fiscal conservative hate that 150b was added to deficit? Yes. The top marginal rate should have stayed the same, and then the rest of the tax cut should have gone through. This would have mitigated some of that 150b annual revenue loss.

That being said, I’m not ignorant enough to think that this bill caused the huge deficits. It made a bad problem slightly worse. Spending is the problem with this country, not revenue generation. It’s literally not possible to tax the rich enough to fund all these programs - any serious solution is going to take cuts to benefits and large scale across the board tax increases. And yes, that means the 45 percent of America who doesn’t pay income tax will have to start paying. But it’s what we need to do to fund healthcare and social security."

It's really also reactionary comments like the one I replied to that imply something else.  Like the suggestion of a female candidate is somehow oppressing men.  Any amount of equality for the oppressed feels like oppression to the oppressors.

My father and I had multiple conversations, more than we’ve ever had before - when Trump was ensconced where he just couldn’t acclimate to the dichotomy of his corruption and lack of decorum, plus no gentlemanly behavior.

>Properly understood, state and local taxes don’t reduce your ability to pay federal income tax, and don’t tax the same dollar of income twice. Instead, they reflect a choice you made to live in a place in which the government provides a certain set of goods and services to taxpayers.

The notion of whether something is or is not double taxation is not based on ""ability to pay"".  If ability to pay was a a reasonable benchmark we'd be taking the upper crust wealthy at 90%.  Does he favor tax shelters?  Do they in any way reduce a person's ability to pay federal income tax?

He'd probably be first in line to claim that the Estate Tax is double taxation when it is the exact opposite.  It's a tax on unrealized capital gains that have never and will never be taxed without that tax.

>Residents of lower-tax states should not be on the hook for spending decisions of governments in higher-tax states. 

So we should all cram into the tiny cluster of states that have no state income tax or sales tax?   As a resident of one of those states, fuck that noise.  I'm totally fine with people being able to deduct their state and local taxes, but it is reasonable for it to be capped."

9800,> ...most taxpayers will have a lower overall tax bill this year because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017...
9801,"80% of people got tax cuts

The tax cuts were disproportionately weighted to the middle class compared to tax burdens. In the top 100/80/60/40/20 quintiles, the breakdowns were 47.1/83.9/89.4/88.2/87.0% with tax cuts, 1.7/6.0/9.2/11.5/12.9% with tax hikes. Of the top 1%, only 79% got tax cuts and 20.5% got tax hikes, more than any other bracket.

Even though the middle quintile pays only 8.9% of the total value of tax burden, they got 13.9% of the share of the total value of tax cuts."
9802,"Average me and Jeff Bezos’ income and i’m a millionaire. However, find the median income and it’s a different story"
9803,"The highest refunds are the lowest income families. Those that get EIC and ACTC. Those returns were held  until this last week, for fraud prevention. So this week's numbers were highly impacted by the tax filings of the lower income families. This is also a group that saw significant increases in refunds.

You can still dislike the tax cut while also being informed and admitting it was a big credit increase for low income. It hurt the middle to upper middle class. Not low income, unless they have a shitty boss that doesn't reimburse work expenses. "
9804,So they are giving more money back to the weathly people
9805,I'm paying roughly $1k more this year (my average return amount minus the fairly inconsequential amounts gained in my bi-weekly paycheck comes out to me losing about 1k)
9806,Great for you.  Mine was $4k less.  
9807,They do file returns (you file a tax return and you get a tax refund) and I am willing to bet based on the labrynth of deductions and subsidies and tax fuckery that the highest paid accountants can figure out results in some significant tax refunds for the mega rich.
9808,"In Cohen's testimony on Tuesday he said Trump showed him a $10 million check from the IRS, and laughed about how stupid the IRS was. The 1% do get refunds, maybe not as often, but it definetly happens. This year would be one where they might get more as they paid based on what they owed the previous year, but they got a big tax cut so they get a lot of it back. Or sometimes people just make end of the year decisions that change their tax liability, like deciding to expense big purchases rather than take depreciation. "
9809,"I got a $120 refund last year and owed $500 this year, and I'm pissed off about it.  My income did not change.  It's all about how they calculated withholdings.  I did not modify my W-4 and it turns out I guess I should have.  It's all ridiculous.  They made it seem like my tax cut was bigger than it really was by changing how my withholdings were calculated based on the information they already had from previous years when my situation hadn't changed between then and now.  I don't understand how they get away with this shit.  They took less out of my paychecks and now they weren't taking enough, it looked like the tax cut benefits me a certain amount with more in my pocket each paycheck, but then come tax return time I find out that it only looked that way because they were not withholding enough and I'm screwed and have to pay 500 bucks I really can't afford to have to pay right now.  It's infuriating.  There must be a lot of people in the same boat as I'm in, right?"
9810,Average can (and is) skewed by the very high end. If you have 5 people and their refunds are (in dollars) 1 1 1 1 101... The average is 105/5 = 21. The median on the other hand would be 1 because it is skewed towards where the majority of the numbers are.
9811,"what are you talking about I don't get a break for anything.

I haven't done my taxes yet, but I assume I'll owe like $2,000

which is really good when you don't work, never will, and are on a fixed income /s

edit if I were able to write off my expenses, then it would deduct from the taxes I owe on my gross income"
9812,"It's not really that simple. So let's say this is a single person making $50,000 a year. Last year they itemized their decuctions, they were able to deduct $8,000 in medical expenses, plus $4,000 in state taxes. So their itemized deductions were $12,000, plus their personal exemption, $4050, so total deductions of $16050, they are taxed on $33,950. Now this year they have the same deduction, but no exemption, so they only get to deduct $12,000, and are taxed on $38,000 in income. 

&#x200B;

Granted they are still likely getting a small tax savings over the old system due to the lower tax rates, but not as much of a savings as others, and not as much as their tax withholding decreased. 

&#x200B;

People who previously itemized deductions get a lesser benefit than than those who had no deductions. 

&#x200B;

That said I don't think this person has a firm grasp on their situation, they probably shouldn't be spewing information, especially before they file their taxes. "

9821,Cohen just testified that trump got a 10 million dollar refund a few years ago. 
9822,"But they typically *pay* taxes since so much of their income isn't taxed over the course of the year.  So when they get these insane deductions, it reduces the taxes they pay.  Maybe that factors into the number cited here?  As I said, I'm ready to believe you, but I'd need a source."
9823,So do we have any data on this?  Is this actually influencing the numbers?
9824,I'm asking... what is the median?  
9825,"> what are you talking about I don't get a break for anything.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""the minimum amount has been raised.""

The medical expense deduction [changed last year](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-reform/medical-expense-deduction-tax-reform/) from being able to deduct expenses more than 10% of your income to being able to deduct expenses in excess of 7.5% of your income. If your income and medical expenses have stayed the same, your deduction should go up. If your income has gone up and/or your expenses have gone down, you may no longer be able to claim this deduction.

But, the standard deduction has doubled. If your itemized deductions including medical expenses come to between $6k and $12k (for a single person, double that if married filing jointly), it previously made sense for you to itemize those deductions whereas now you automatically get a full $12k deducted from your taxable income and you shouldn't itemize your medical expenses."
9826,"I lost a lot of deductions. 

I paid more in taxes and saw virtually no change in my paycheck and lost money on my returns.   My effective tax rate went up around 2.5%.   "

9828,"How have we not eaten the rich by now?  We outnumber them, we're better armed and we surround them.  They are fat and likely tastey.  How have we not had them for dinner by now?"
9829,"Teachers did keep their $250 above the line deduction for classroom supplies in the final bill. They can't deduct anything beyond that, including union dues and other work related expenses. "
9830,Yeah but if I got an extra $1.50 in my pay checks then it balances out right?
9831,"I don't have any data, just pointing out the 1% does in fact get refunds."
9832,No idea because they won't publish it. Probably because it shows they are down and the IRS/white house wants to make it sound like the tax law isn't a huge scam
9833,"> if your income has gone up and/or your expenses have gone down, you may no longer be able to claim this deduction.

and it did. last year my salary was the highest it's ever been. I didn't know that I would be diagnosed with MS, so incurred those charges.

from Feb -July I received 80% of my month's gross income, and July - Dec 60%. but prior, I got a raise, and a big bonus (for me it is, probably like $2,500), and actually some other financial bonuses for excelling at my job.

9963,That is true.

Disclaimer:  I'm a former Southern Baptist/Evangelical/Calvary.

It's a human sacrifice death cult, with numerous references to hate one another and doublespeak for 'love'.  From perpetual genocide against Amalek forever, to the 24 trillion person Genocide in Revelation.  Even when Paul says love remembers no wrong, yet god clearly does and is love at the same time.  A mutual contradiction.

You're taught whatever your pastors want you to behave like, with zero objectivity.

I don't think you understand.  It is clear, to us in California, we are hated.  We're hated for our culture.  We're hated for our surfing.  We're hated for hollywood.  We're hated for technology, and we're hated for our economy even though it's leached off of by the red states.  We're just hated.  We listened and accepted it.  We are hated.  Cool story.

>Often functioning as propaganda outlets, the major news media serve as an amplification system for corporate power that has long shielded the Democratic Party from the combined “threats” of social movements and progressive populist candidates. The synergies of momentum from the left—outside and inside of electoral arenas—are continuing to accelerate.

>It’s crucial that progressives develop more effective challenges to the media serving the predatory big-money system. More than any other force, reflexive spin from corporate media stands between us and a Bernie Sanders presidency."

10020,"It is weirdly hilaious to see so much media bashing on outlets like MSNBC, e.g. the huge thread bashing MSNBC as propaganda and in the pocket of the establishment because one of their panelists said something negative about Bernie, *after they had just carried his entire speech live*."
10021,Truthdig is a right wing website?
10022,"Media ignored Bernie for a long time. Then they were nice to him for a while. Then they started trashing him unfairly.

There was no rigging. There was Bernie bros who were sore losers. Nothing in the emails showed rigging. Nobody stopped you from voting for Bernie. Russia or whoever released the emails knowing Bernies cult would read too much into them and create a scandal. And you're still falling for it. "
10036,He lost the primary by millions of votes. It was over by Super Tuesday but he soldiered on to the convention despite the fact that he had little to no chance to catch up after the beating he took in the south.

10038,Gabbard was ride or die.. there is smoke. 
10039,"Well I think it depends.  If Bernie keeps up this lead, there’s no way they can ignore him.  But if Biden jumps in, absolutely.  The media has had a hardon for Biden for the past 4 years.  Every time they discuss democratic candidates they spend just as much time on Biden.  But right now it’s Bernie, Harris, and Warren in the top 3.  Those three are the three most progressive candidates"
10040,"Corporate media is in it for corporate power. The media was Bernie's biggest obstacle in 2016. But now that he is known, things will be different. He will be treated in 2020 the way media treated Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The media was gloves off of Hillary for the most part until they got Bernie out of the way. But once that happened -- once it really mattered -- they bent toward Donald Trump. Sure, they trashed Donald Trump in outrageous ways all the time, but that didn't convince anyone of anything except to boast Donald Trump's fake outsider status. They also gave him more free live time to say whatever he wanted. They did not cover many of the Donald Trump and Republican scandals, and particularly the way Republicans routinely steal elections and the way they were planning to do so in 2016.

Finally, they covered lots of the Republican anti-Hillary propaganda while refusing to take on some of the crazier conspiracies like Seth Rich head on. The silence of corporate media in the face of the internet flooded with these stories also played into the 'MSM is Democrats' propaganda.

In the end, the corporations got exactly what they wanted: the most reactionary person of all. It is no coincidence that the stock market went insane after Donald Trump was declared the winner.

Not to mention that superdelegates may have played a role in swaying the election in her favor. When you see on every news channel 538-10, how would that not influence some votes. 

It wasn’t over on Super Tuesday dude. Saying there was no chance is subjective. The more Bernie spoke the more popular he got, and the more Hillary spoke the less she got. "
10045,"Their half assed operation ""supporting Bernie"" was them attacking Hillary with the lamest memes and posting pictures of a shirtless Bernie Sanders coloring book.

Truly game changing.

Meanwhile they boosted #blm too. So tell me: does that mean they should close up shop and stop protesting, or does it just say that thre's apparently dudes in Russia who have a better idea of what people on the left want than anyone running the DNC in 2016?"
10046,"Wow, say anything that can be remotely construed as negative towards Bernie, and get downvoted beyond belief.   I'm kinda ambivalent towards him myself, but agree with your analysis of the 2016 election.  I'm not sure the media or the DNC is his biggest obstacle now though, I think the fact that he will be in a more crowded field of younger candidates with many of the same positions will work against, as will his age.  

That all said, I will not be sitting this one out like I did in 2016, and if he's the candidate, I'll be doing everything I can to help him get into office."

You see that [dip in the coverage](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-presidential-primaries) of Bernie Sanders on Figure 1? That is just before Super Tuesday. There was less coverage and obviously, lots of that was negative as the 16 stories in 16 hours indicates."
10050,"That's from early 2016, and it is a stretch to call all of them negative.  Bernie does have a good record with the NRA, which I have mixed feelings about, and to point out where he differed with Obama and Clinton is not negative."
10051,That's terrible but not the DNC.
10052,"Populism is a pretty simple recipe, you complain about shit all day and point out shit that’s broken. Grievance politics isn’t rocket science. You give a populist a megaphone and a percentage of people are going to be influenced by it. That’s all Russia did was give the populists megaphones. They did it with trump, sanders, le pen, brexit, Corsica.. It won’t stop, we just have to call it for what it is. "
10053,"I won't do the anti-Bernie or anti-Hillary stuff, and I see some of both on this page. I didn't do it then, and I won't do it now. :)"
10054,">it's debatable

Ok. Lets have a *debate* over this right here.

She said this:

>""To be very serious about it, I clocked it,"" said Maxwell. ""He did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into the speech. And just for point of comparison, I looked at Elizabeth Warren's opening speech for example, she mentioned race and discrimination in the first paragraph.

There's nothing rhetorical about a living wage and universal healthcare. Both would immediately change millions of people's lives for the better.

What minor tax increased the middle classa and below would see would be immediately offset by the fact that they'd no longer have to pay health insurance. The average family would come out *thousands* of dollars ahead. That's not a regressive policy, that's a progressive one.

A VAT, like all of Europe uses, raises revenue, in Europe its 20% of their total revenue raised. People who aren’t on the grid pay, rich people pay, tourists pay, immigrants pay.. not just working poor. You have to get to the revenue that flows through entities to get to rich people. I can shell game money all day and not pay taxes. One time I created a GP and an LLC, I gave the LLC 1% of the partnership and made it the managing partner, all the employees worked for the LLC.i didn’t pay franchise tax, I didn’t pay social security, I took my money as a distribution in a K1 and wrote off so much shit that I barely paid anything.

10211,"> *Without the proper framing of the foreign policy questions we face, Democrats will have trouble building consensus around the right approach, even if they get one or another specific decision right.*  

Broadly speaking, the essence of the problem that American foreign policy faces is the **[existence of other countries with authoritarian governments](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/map)**.  America's democratic instinct is to have the countries of the world engage in honest debate of global issues (the US even created and hosted the **[United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/)** in order to provide a forum for this purpose) which ultimately leads to global agreement on what is genuinely the best solution for humanity.  The difficulty, of course, is that authoritarian governments give zero fucks about the best solution for humanity and are only interested in the solution or non-solution which best serves their own greedy self-interest.   And even democratic governments sometimes engage in **[the amoral \(or immoral, or even criminal\) pursuit of greedy self-interest](https://kurdistantribune.com/henry-kissinger-realpolitik-genocide/)**.   

**[Realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_Among_Nations)** thus demands that American foreign policy be adjusted accordingly.   

Ultimately, American foreign policy should aim to build a peaceful and democratic world community.  A prerequisite for this is the improvement of the quality of governance in countries where governance is of unreasonably low quality.  Authoritarian countries (those that are **[not free](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/map)**) are the primary problems here.  

Two approaches to foreign policy can and should be pursued in parallel.  First, the world must be partitioned into two sets: countries whose governments are of reasonable quality, and countries whose governments fail that standard.   

The approach toward countries whose governments are of reasonable quality is one of peaceful debate and agreements.  Treaties are signed to promote cooperation among good governments.  Everyone works together to promote the common good.  

The approach toward countries whose governments fail that standard must be different.  Here, the question is how to best promote the country's transition toward freedom while at the same time containing and minimizing the negative effects generated by the country's unreasonably poor government.    

The exact approach used will necessarily be specific to the country in question.  For larger countries, economic and political tactics will be preferred (whether they have any reasonable chance of short-term success or not), and military strategy will be aimed at containment.  For smaller countries in which economic and political tactics are clearly ineffective (especially those with Stalinist governments with a history of committing crimes against humanity such as genocide), military intervention may be the appropriate response.   

Military intervention has proven its value in multiple cases.  Authoritarian governments in Japan, Germany, and Italy were first defeated militarily and then forcibly converted into democracies.  And other countries have used military intervention to successfully transition countries away from authoritarian government: **[Vietnamese military intervention in Cambodia swiftly ended the ""Killing Fields"" genocide](https://allthatsinteresting.com/cambodian-genocide)**.  However, as with the Vietnam-Cambodia example, the resulting increase in the quality of government has sometimes left much to be desired.  

Currently there is a debate regarding the proper approach toward authoritarian Venezuela.  Some argue that **[nonviolent resistance is the best approach](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/431996-any-us-military-intervention-in-venezuela-will-be-counterproductive)** for now, and that may well be true.  But circumstances can change.  Democrats should not categorically rule out either military aid (just as France provided military aid to the Revolutionaries during the American War Of Independence) or military intervention, one or both of which could in the end turn out to be the best way to effectively promote better government.   Yet Democrats must also strongly argue in favor of non-violent resistance, as long as it still stands a reasonable chance of being successful.  "
10212,"I'd rather the Dems stand against military intervention in the case of Venezuela, at least for the time being. There's a lot to lose there (lives, cost, etc.) and Trump lacks the leadership skills, knowledge, and experience to be able to conduct any type of useful intervention there.

There's also the track record of poor results from American interference in South/Central America just generally speaking.

I think the better play here for Dems is to better support emerging/established democracies in the region. "
10213,"Our involvement in another sovereign nations affairs isn't democratic, its imperialistic.  Its why we tend to frown on other nations involving themselves in our democratic process.  A democracy requires the citizens of the nation to take control, not be handed control by a foreign nation.  How many countries do we need to fuck up before this sinks in.  

&#x200B;

Is Venezuela a mess?  Yep, but pretending we didn't help push it along by pretending to have a serious debate about what we should do is just dishonest.  We've already decided what to do in Venezuela, we stirred the pot until we got here.

&#x200B;

But now apparently, our policy folks like our economist want to ignore our involvement so they can justify their next course of action.  They wanted the country to devolve into an authoritarian dictatorship precisely so they could justify a regime change.  They can't ever let a competing economic system go unmolested.

&#x200B;

How about the Dems let Venezuelans worry about Venezuela until Venezuela is harming someone other than themselves or the majority are asking for international help.  Dems didn't take to kindly to Russia deciding to help the Republicans so it seems a bit hypocritical to force ourselves on others.  On the other hand, lots of capitalist dollars to be made down there cleaning up.  Sure that's just a coincidence though."

10269,"If people want ""equality of opportunity"" then they should be 100% in favor of estate taxes and funding for education."
10270,"""You will often hear a distinction drawn between two different kinds of equality: equality of “opportunity” and equality of “outcome.” The people who draw this distinction often say that they believe in the former but not the latter. Equality of “opportunity” is desirable, but equality of “outcome” is not. As they frame it, one of these is fairly basic while the other is radical and frightening. If we were to try to ensure equal “outcomes” we would have to create a colossal social transformation. It would resemble the dystopia of Kurt Vonnegut’s “Harrison Bergeron,” in which able-bodied people were saddled with weights so that they could not dance better than disabled people, etc. The people who distinguish opportunity and outcome often do so in order to discourage us from trying to redistribute wealth from rich to poor—what matters is not whether people end up highly unequal, but whether they have the same opportunities at the start. If life is a race, it’s okay if there are “winners” and “losers” so long as the race is played fairly. “Equality of opportunity” describes the conditions under which the results of the race should be accepted: Everyone went in with the same ability to succeed, but some people came out ahead of others.

It’s very tempting to accept this framework, because it allows for a clean distinction between “capitalist” and “communist” equality. We capitalists believe that everyone should be equally able to pursue the good life, whereas the communists make the error of believing that everyone is equally entitled to the good life, and introduce all kinds of distortions and horrors in their efforts to force equality upon a highly unequal world. The wise egalitarian simply makes sure the “rules of the game” are set up fairly and doesn’t try to meddle with the outcome, even if that outcome is highly inegalitarian."""

10341,"As John Judas explained [over a decade ago](https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=19028&prog=zgp&proj=zusr):

>There is a paradox that haunts these charges of anti-Semitism. On the one hand, Rosenfeld, Harris, and others want to deny that American Jews and American Jewish organizations like AIPAC suffer from dual loyalty in trying to influence U.S. foreign policy. It's anti-Semitic or contributes to anti-Semitism, they say, to make that charge. On the other hand, they want to demand of American Jewish intellectuals a certain loyalty to Israel, Israeli policies, and to Zionism as part of their being Jewish. They make dual loyalty an inescapable part of being Jewish in a world in which a Jewish state exists. And that's probably the case. Many Jews now suffer from dual loyalty--the same way that Cuban-Americans or Mexican-Americans do. By ignoring this dilemma--and, worse still, by charging those who acknowledge its existence with anti-Semitism--the critics of the new anti-Semitism are engaged in a flight from their own political selves. They are guilty of a certain kind of bad faith. 

Such bad faith accusations are a toxic distraction to anyone with respect for reality, Democrats and otherwise."
10342,"sigh... ok... (opens wallet)

I've started donating to her every time there is another fake outrage story about here"
10343,"She accused Israel of all that, and that all is demonstrably true of Israel. She never once said ""all Jews"" or even ""Jews"" did that."
10344,"Except every single one of those things is demonstrably true but have nothing inherently to do with judaism, being jewish, etc. This is manufactured outrage at its finest."
10345,Your projection is showing. Criticism of Israeli war crimes=/ anti-Semitism
10346,"This is the same criticism the right has about Mexicans immigrating to America but still hanging a Mexican flag outside their home.  
People have an allegiance to their college sports teams, to their favorite clothing brands, to our national allies.   She has the right to question if some of that leads to undue influence.  "

10356,"Rep. Eliot Engel, the Democratic Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, [released this statement in response to Rep. Omar's most recent comments:](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/432298-foreign-affairs-committee-chair-denounces-new-omar-statements-on-israel)

> “I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy, but it’s unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,” Engel said in a statement.

> “Her comments were outrageous and deeply hurtful, and I ask that she retract them, apologize, and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives.”

> ... **The concept of dual loyalty has been a historical aspect of anti-Semitism, with nations accusing its Jewish populations of secretly valuing their loyalty to Israel over their home country.**

> “The charge of dual loyalty not only raises the ominous specter of classic anti-Semitism, but it is also deeply insulting to the millions upon millions of patriotic Americans, Jewish and non-Jewish, who stand by our democratic ally, Israel,” Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for AIPAC, said in a statement to The Times."
10357,"> Uh. Where does it say that Jewish people are pushing for allegiance? 

I don't know, why don't you ask Omar? She's the one who said it.

She's so stupid and hateful she does not even realize she's repeating bigoted things that have been said for a century."
10358,"If the Dems cave on this libelous nonsense again, they'll start to alienate people.   People attacking Omar are transparently racist."
10359,"Or if they covered up the rape of young boys...  oh wait, they did that."
10360,Check out all the parts of Rome Vatican City has illegally annexed.   Indigenous Romans can't move without encountering Papal checkpoints.  Bishops routinely shoot unarmed protesters with sniper rifles.
10361,"If MomentarySpark's comment is to be taken as a historical reference, a much older one is [more fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicarii):

>The Sicarii (Modern Hebrew: סיקריים siqari'im) were a splinter group of the Jewish Zealots who, in the decades preceding Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE, heavily opposed the Roman occupation of Judea and attempted to expel them and their sympathizers from the area. The Sicarii carried sicae, or small daggers, concealed in their cloaks. At public gatherings, they pulled out these daggers to attack Romans and Hebrew Roman sympathizers alike, blending into the crowd after the deed to escape detection.

10362,"Its not a lie, I am not calling her antisemetic.  But her statement is toxic and it makes us look bad.  "
10363,"> She added, ""I want to ask, 'Why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the [National Rifle Association], or fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policy?'""

The difference is that all of the above are American interests, not foreign interests.

Since apparently a lot of people are not understanding what she said, she is implying that to be pro-Israel is indicative of someone's ALLEGIANCE to that foreign state. Meaning, their interests are not purely American.   Meaning, that if you are pro-Israel you are basically a traitor."

10371,AFAIK AIPAC is run by American Jews. Hence the charge of anti-semitism if you accuse them of pushing allegiance to a foreign country.
10372,"That's just a completely ignorant thing to say.  Do you really feel that Israel is worse than a China, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc?

This does not mean they commit inexcusable acts. I also think the US commits mistakes as well. That doesn't mean that I think they're an evil actor on the world stage. 

The world is not a black and white place. Can we stop pretending it is?"
10373,"My point was to criticize elected Democrats whose stances have direct, material effects. I’m sure some people are equally critical of both, but they don’t include a significant amount of people actually in office. The party was simply more critical of one than the other, because the party is Islamophobic.

To say nothing of how these controversies really aren’t equal. Omar’s criticism was based in fact, whereas this is just hate speech."
10374,I was hoping it wasn't necessary. 
10375,Its not! She is saying if you support Israel you have an allegiance to that country.

10379,"> are American

AIPAC is an American interest group too. What else could it be?

> she is implying

No **you** are implying that. Her point was about money and influence. Your (intentional?) misunderstanding doesn’t change her obvious actual point. "
10380,"Isn't it AIPAC's position that if you are not pro-Israel, you should be barred from participation in formal public life or even contracting with governments?"
10381,Bad faith dipshit argument. 
10382,Sure.
10383,"Considering the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not rapists or violent criminals, no, the two situations aren't remotely equivalent. Your just putting your own ignorance and/or bigotry on display here."
10384,You're picking an odd city on a hill to die on. 
10385,Does AIPAC push to pass laws that make it illegal to protest Israel or not?
10386,"> Do you really feel that Israel is worse than a China, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc?

Can’t speak for OP, but I think Israel belongs in a conversation with those countries sooner than it does, say, modern Germany."
10387,[deleted]
10388,"I largely agree. The disgusting hate speech directed at her is absurd and evil. It is definitely more vile and more forward than any issues with what she has been saying. That being said, one being worse than the other doesn't make hers ok. "
10389,"Is this what Trump supporters say when we call him on his BS about trying to block all Muslims from entering the US?

You are trying to change the narrative.  Omar said that if you support Israel you have allegiance to another country. That is a racist, intolerant statement.   "
10390,The second half of her statement doesn’t change anything?  I can accuse someone of having allegiance to NRA and that’s not offensive. But accusing someone of having an allegiance to a foreign country means they’re a traitor to the US.  They are two different things.  
10391,She said ‘push for allegiance to a foreign country’.  Please read the article.  You’re being deliberately obtuse.  
10392,"Yes, they do.  How is that relevant? The NRA wants to let any kook buy a gun.  The difference is that AIPAC does not equal the US Government just as the NRA does not equal the US Government."
10393,"So if you are a Democrat and support Israel you are “bought”?

You do understand how that is a very offensive statement, right?"
10394,[removed]
10395,Laws that prohibits protesting a foreign nation are an attempt to force allegiance to that foreign country. Calling out a lobby group trying to force these laws is the opposite of that. AIPAC does the former and she said the latter and you’re cutting off half her sentence in order to dishonestly claim the opposite of obvious reality. 
10396,"But AIPAC is a lobbying group trying to enforce allegiance to Israel and punishment of any who boycott or protest them - via law.  They are lobbying on behalf of a specific state in the way the NRA lobbies on behalf of gun rights.  They have two different objectives, so protesting ""allegiance"" to one has a different meaning than the other, even if the method of arriving at that protest is identical.  That doesn't implicate the validity of the protest or the logical conclusion."
10397,"It doesn't. It's true you can't have allegiance to North Korea and South Korea at the same time, but there's no reason you can't be loyal to more than one allied country. It's the whole reason NATO exists. If Russia pushes into Poland, we shed blood in their defense. When 9/11 happened, Poles shed blood for us."
10398,Alliegiance to money. The NRA is just another example of it  
10399,"She said ""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.""

You’re being deliberately dishonest and uncivil as you cut off half the quote to make your argument. "
10400,"> yes they do 

So they want allegiance to a foreign nation and speaking against them is not. Literally the opposite of your claim about Omar. "
10401,"BUt this isn't about AIPAC, it's about AIPAC lobbying to pass laws that forbid people from *not* showing allegiance or agreement with Israel.  How are the anti-BDS laws, such as the contracting law in Texas and in 25 other states, not a requirement that one show allegiance to Israel, given that any act of boycotting or protesting Israel will lead to one being fired (if an independent contractor) or impoverished or bankrupted (if one is a contractor primarily working with the state)?"
10402,"You do realize Netanhyahu and the Republicans, who are loyal to RUSSIA and not America, all have one thing in common holding them together: Money.

We have proof, through Flynn and Manafort and Stone, that foreign monetary interests EXIST, AND WORK.

To deny this simply because its AIPAC and Jews in question is to use their religion as a shield and a bludgeon against legitimate, secular, political criticism, and I, as an atheist, am tired of paying lip service to walk on eggshells around everyones preferred pet bronze age delusion/fantasy/mental illness. You are involved in a secular government. If you cant keep your religious claptrap nonsense out of it, theres the door."

"
10409,"Is it possible that there are common interests between the US and Israel, yes or no?

If the interests are shared, and I support the policy, does that mean that I support Israel?"

But can you prove that all people who support Israel are bought?

I am an atheist, moderate Democrat. I am not Jewish.  Am I ""bought""?"
10411,"They look like they're using antisemitic stereotypes as cover so that when you call out their actual behavior, they can accuse you of antisemitism."

How unpatriotic of you. Thankfully this country gives me the **freedom** to jerk off onto the flag and burn it on top of a pile of guns."

Thank god, I thought I was the only one.

On a serious note, our country was founded on the idea of the right of revolution. And I’m sure that idea (and the first amendment) allows for non-violent protest.

It could very well be argued that expression of opposition for the state is a quintessential american ideal, and necessary in a democracy.

While I know a few people that express and support the most extreme conservative views seen online.  They don't seem to have any limit, are even happy to support conservative policies that will hurt them and take advantage of liberal policies that help them.

The demographics of my peers would be part of the reason.

I would like to believe the extreme voices online are trolls etc, unfortunately my experience IRL tells me I am wrong."

10549,Why are we still using averages? A single outlier can skew all the data. We need to be using median refunds
10550,For the rich? I make about 40k a year. I paid more and got back less.
10551,"What's especially amusing about this attempt, is the [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/some-retailers-are-starting-to-feel-the-pinch-from-delayed-tax-refunds-132248252.html) that was posted literally right after it:

>As this tax-filing season has seen a slow start, businesses from big box retailers to restaurant chains, are starting to face some initial pressure on sales.

>At the end of the first three weeks in the tax season, total tax refunds returns were down by 38.8% compared to last year. This has impacted some businesses that usually expect a lift in sales from customers who spend their tax refund money. Analysts at UBS say retailers levered to lower income demographics or specializing in home improvement will be impacted the most by lower or delayed tax refunds.

>“We're feeling a little bit of softness right now due to what has very clearly publicly been both a quantity of tax returns being down, but also the amount per return right now is down,” Best Buy (BBY) CFO Corie Barry said during an earning call on Wednesday. Internal Revenue Service data by mid-February shows an average refund dropped to $2,640 from $3,169 last year. The retailer said it has incorporated that into its guidance for the first quarter of 2019.

"
10552,"But what is the median tax refund?  If 1 person gets an extra billion dollars back, and a million people get $900 less, the average refund is up $100.  The median refund would show -$900 which would be more accurate for what the ""average"" person would expect."
10553,Average being the key word here folks. Real easy to get that number into the positive column when the Devos's of the world can write off jets and receive massive tax breaks just for being rich.

10563,"Why are people reporting the refund amount?

The refund means nothing. I’d be much more interested in knowing the change in effective tax rate for individuals.

My effective federal tax rate was 14.46% this year. Last year was 13.9%. My income was also significantly higher this year though as I got a bunch of money for relocating for work, so I think had my income stayed the same my effective tax rate would have been down vs 2017."

10569,"Because 2,000,000 fewer refunds were issued and 2,200,000 fewer returns were processed."
10570,Refunds are the result of over withholding though. You can pay less taxes overall and still get a refund if you withhold properly. 
10571,The top 10% (I assume you mean 90th percentile income) are the least likely to get tax refunds.

10576,You're 100% right but people are stupid and think of their refund as a windfall rather than an interest free loan to the government. I always make sure my refund is as low as possible.

10587,"Dude that's like, four bananas."
10588,"Withholding rules changed because the White House realized they were getting negative press about people's paychecks not increasing after the corporate tax cuts. It's actually a good thing to be more aggressive about minimizing withholdings, but the administration has been selling up GDP and spending increases that partially just represent taking some windfall income from February through April and spreading it throughout the year. Until now, the White House  has gotten nothing but the upside of that trade off, and it's been some really tame upside. I think it's appropriate to be negative about this change, not in calling it a tax increase, but in noting that the tax cuts have had an even lower impact to workers and the middle class than we had already realized."
10589,"But people didnt notice the reduced withholdings over the year since that reduction was so small, but they are noticing the refunds are smaller.  So it is the worst of both worlds for people."
10590,"Less than half, even, since there are more females than males."
10591,"the word ""average"", is why. we need to know the median and mode"
10592,If you count the millions the wealthy get it probably averages to an extra $40.

10600,"Yeah, I appreciated your reference to the remodeled house and car."
10601,Another great point.
10602,"Not quite.  The trick is that less people received refunds at all.  So far less money has been refunded to taxpayers ($4,000,000,000 as GP said), but they can still say that technically returns are on average higher."

10634,This reads like an endorsement of bisexual anal sex
10635,I generally agree but some people demand effort and that's just the way it is.
10636,"We don't know if it was abuse or just whining.  And if a man did that, everyone would just think he's ""driven"" or something."
10637,"Because that's all anyone has been talking about for weeks now. She has no chance anymore. She's the ""staffer problem lady""."
10638,Staffers. Virtually the same as human beings.
10639,Even the podsaveamerica folks very clearly communicated their view on the accusation by their nondefense. Instead they focused on how 'everu staffer knows whom to avoid'.

10640,">> “You’d wake up to a string of four, five, six, seven, eight e-mails of increasing anger, with everybody copied,” said one. “It was, ‘This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. Naive. Stupid. Awful.’ It was just this vitriol. You didn’t wake up to it every single day, but it was enough that my stomach just clenched every morning the second I woke up.”

>> Another former staffer also described frequent late-night or early-morning e-mails from Klobuchar when she was upset about something: “Very personal attacks day after day. How long can you be called an idiot before you believe it?”

>> One of the former staffers, a woman, was angered by defenses of Klobuchar on feminist grounds. The source said she didn’t think feminism excused bullying.

There's enough stories out there from reputed outlets like the local newspaper and the New York Times that they are not baseless charges. How are they being 'propped up and spread by the GOP'?"
10641,throwing a stapler at someone is abuse.  its not sexist to call that bullshit out.  i work in politics and her rep is that she is absolutely abusive to her staff.

Yikes."

10646,"1. Republicans will never like a dem so I don’t care about what they talk about.

2. As a dem I think Republicans targeted her on a sexist basis because her numbers are so good

3. Don’t be a fucking pussy. Dems let Howard dean get smeared over a fucking sound he emitted. How about we focus on policy and stop being so worried about what excuse people find to explain why they irrationally hate solid candidates."
10647,Maybe we should have staffers decide who our next president is.
10648,"She isn’t going to make it through primaries most likely, so this is a bit silly to even argue about. 

a few things things tho:

1. If she does, vote for her, even if she’s not the best boss. Because Trump is worse in just about every way.

2. The timing and substance of the whole story is very obviously a smear campaign. I’m not defending her behavior as a boss, sounds like she’s bad, but I also don’t think it’s fair to vilify her and feed into the attempt to sow division.  I don’t want to buy in to a smear campaign.

3. From the quotes I read, she can be mean but there is now sexual or physical abuse going on. Verbally, she may cross that line, but some how only bad enough that all these people only decided to talk about it 3 days before her campaign launched. So I don’t agree with the alleged behavior, but the political timing of it also makes me think the sources are suspicious "
10649,"Lol dude. I’m electing a politician to fight for my interests. I don’t need fucking Jesus. Hell, nice guys ain’t gonna fight hard enough anyway. I want someone to go to the White House ready to dog walk Republicans. Idgaf if they treat some of their staffers shitty. It’s literally my lowest concern."
10650,"You'd be surprised what junk those with a political angle will print, reeks of a republican smear job. Even if true, is sexist to constantly focus on these issues that happen in every office run by men. If she was not a woman that challenges the establishment, this would never make the press"
10651,Sometimes an incompetent staff is maddening.
10652,It is very rational to not like a candidate due to how they treat others. We have multiple strong candidates and if others are relatively equal I don't have to choose a person who demeans those 'below her'.
10653,"Like, for being an asshole?"
10654,Klobuchar is worse than Biden.
10655,"The other problem is that she's playing into it. She has toasted herself.

There are other, stronger candidates to focus on. Maybe she still can salvage this but she has to be smart."
10656,"Maybe the popular vote, this time."
10657,No dealing with your brand of idiocy.
10658,"Well, it is ours. We live in a time of good and evil, and I will choose right."
10659,It's easier for assholes to be exposed as assholes nowadays. Male or female-fuck'em.
10660,"Yah freal. Does anyone think Mitch McConnell is a nice dude to work for? What about trump? What about Clinton? I mean.. he banged his staffers.

Idgaf.

Do your fucking job and make this country a better place to live in for millions of people. If it’s at the expense of some staffers comfort at work so be it."
10661,"The problem is that you have no idea how other candidates treat their staff as it’s never been an issue. I mean, we’ve heard bad stories about tons of people in the past, but it’s never been an issue. Why? Because there was never the expectation that a male candidate would be nurturing. A male leader can be demanding of his staff and people don’t really care. It’s the whole male leaders can be assholes and people don’t care, but female leaders can be bitches and suddenly they are super unelectable. The expectation that a female candidate would be nurturing or nice and can’t be demanding or rude is a sexist expectation. As a result, she’s getting bad coverage because people are finding this story “unusual,” when what’s unusual is the reporting not the characteristics themselves. Lots of politicians are shitty to work for. Most of the staffer jobs are super fucking shitty. Long hours, low pay, lots of turnover. They are totally shit jobs. Everyone in those positions have tons of complaints and are happy to rage about all sorts of shit. It’s a bullshit story because her polling was super good. It would be like saying you eat Wendy’s instead of McDonald’s because you hear cashiers hate working at McDonald’s. It’s ignorance masquerading as concern."
10662,"What does that even mean. Is she 3 million years old, sexually harassing women on the reg, incapable of staying in message/focused, and constantly putting his foot in his mouth with unforced gaffes? Because those are his issues and they ain’t good either."
10663,It’s a fight between good vs evil so you pick the least offensive candidate possible rather than the most effective politician.

You don’t know which other candidates treat their staffers shitty because it’s not something that’s ever been something anyone cares about. It’s just a smear campaign.

You all are furthering his rhetoric by being part of the problem. Not all viewpoints contrary to yours are that of the ""nazis,"" and herein lies the problem. As a left of center moderate, I can honestly say this is the only thing that trump has ever done right. Of course it will be tossed in court, but it's a reaction to a rather sinister campaign by radical leftists to censor speech that really doesn't need to be censored. You all are correct in your statements though- universities are under no obligation to provide ""platforms of hate,"" whatever the fuck that is. They are also under no obligation to receive millions/billions in Federal funding (that they use to drive research with critically underpaid graduate students). The last problem with most of your comments (besides trying to say anyone can actually define ""hate speech,"") is that you all are asserting that Nazis are actually being invited to speak and turned down. No. Perfectly civil people like Mark Rubin are being harrased to the point of not even being able to hear himself think. Others are being assaulted, as we all know what happened at Berkely. Some are being threatened with such credible violence they must bring their own security (Ben Shapiro- who I disagree with on most things, but he should be allowed to fucking speak and have a discussion with people who both agree and disagree. In fact, mainly those who disagree). The fact of the matter is what the universities (and more broadly, Twitter mobs of SJWs) are doing is completely wrong and if they don't want to support the very foundation of our democracy, then they shouldn't get a dime of our democracies money. 

I'll finish by quoting Sam Harris, who hits the nail rather concisely on the head:

""There are many double standards that are quite harmful. For instance, it is illegal in France and Germany and many other countries in Western Europe to deny the Holocaust. That's a bad law. A person should be absolutely free to deny the Holocaust. Which is to say he should be free to destroy his reputation."""
10725,"Anyone who feels entitled to enforce their politics with street violence can go fuck themselves. I was at the so-called ""Battle of Berkeley."" Here's how it started. Milo Yianopolis (I don't if that's the right spelling. Don't care enough to check) tried to give a speech in a room that seats around 200. He was hosted by the student Republicans. At this stage of the saga there were no right-wing extremists present or involved except for Milo himself. 

Antifa broke windows, set the building on fire, assaulted dozens of people (mainstream conservatives, not Nazis--the Nazis weren't there the first day. They showed up in response to all this), looted stores, started fires, vandalized everything they could get their hands on and generally left a miles-long, multimillion-dollar path of destruction through the most liberal city in the world.

There was global news coverage. Milo Yianopolis' nonsense reached billions instead of hundreds. His next book leapt over a hundred spots to the number-one pre-order on amazon. He became a household name. Right wing extremists are STILL making political hay from the indefensible actions of those self-appointed guardians of the public discourse. That's all this is. Trump is still coasting on the political capital those fucking idiots handed him that day in Berkeley.

And what finally made Milo go away? Firebombs? Bludgeoning bystanders with bike locks? No. Letting him talk. He eventually said some crazy shit and the crowd turned on him. Giving him a global audience was more destructive to his message than all the efforts to silence him combined. There's nothing so destructive to a crackpot than letting reasonable people hear them out.

tl:dr Violent counter-protestors, stop ""helping."" You're making it worse."

10727,"> Citing free speech laws, Trump said universities would risk losing federal funding if they failed to protect conservatives’ right to their viewpoints.

10975,"Yes, she could have not prosecuted a company that was allowing minors to be trafficked. And she chose not to."
10976,"Ah, so yet again you don't think sex workers are people. Got it. "
10977,Snowflake in chief needs his safe space. 
10978,“They love me! They really love me!”
10979,">As he wrapped up his speech, and before The Rolling Stones song “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” played on the loudspeakers, Trump bragged how nobody had left the room early before he finished talking. Trump said this literally as as a fairly long, conspicuous procession of attendees and students had been filing out of the room early. Several attendees directly behind the press pen started laughing at the juxtaposition.

LOL! What a loser.

&#x200B;"
10980,Bullshit was a fantastic show and I hated when showtime took it off. Penn and Teller are great. Lol
10981,"So basically if he is hanging with people who will give him anything he can win, but in the real world he is a loser every time. 

Ever notice he is exactly like those neo nazi's who when together pretend to be strong, but when caught in public cry like little children?  "
10982,Trump is so used to failure I don't think it really bothers him much. And he's definitely too ignorant to feel humiliated. Remember when the whole world laughed at him at the UN? It barely even registered.
10983,"Yeah, racism still plays to small-minded morons. Go figure "
10984,Rails... of adderall.
10985,Two hours of blathering rambling idiot shit is not winning.
10986,Accountability bitches. This is how it works.
10987,He could have shit on the stage and he'd get cheered over there by those idiots.
10988,This fuck always needs to go back to a safe space of braying bootlickers after a couple weeks in the real world. It's so sad. What a beta. 
10989,So many rails.
10990,Winner? lmfao
10991,"Don had a slow-motion temper tantrum on television.  Again. 

So much ""winning""."
10992,Lower. I'm thinking lamebda.
10993,Why👏are👏we👏talking👏about👏this👏guy👏?!
10994,Howard Schultz thinks he is so dignified and lofty.  That is exactly why we do not need him as President.
10995,Still have no idea what this guys proposed platform is outside of ‘both sides bad’ and ‘protect billionaires’ - and I don’t think he does either.
10996,"Seriously, who gives a fuck about this guy? "
10997,"As they say in Seattle, what a douche"
10998,Who cares?  Schultz is a joke
10999,Crusty old billionaire Howard Schultz tries to be relevant. Cute.
11000,Who cares about this (R) pretending to be an independent? A guy that is scared his taxes will go up. 
11001,Looks like I have to continue boycotting star bucks...
11002,Boycott Starbucks. We need more independent coffee shops. 
11003,Howard Schultz is a sad spectacle.
11004,I thought he finally realized no one is feeling him.
11005,It’s funny because that’s how I describe his flirtation with politics.
11006,Wtf? The republicans covering for Trump is equivalent to *reported* disagreements between the democrats? I get that his whole argument is ‘both sides bad!’ but this one makes no sense at all.
11007,Instead of boycotting starbucks when you go there to get a drink bring some pamphlets about creating unions and pass them out to the employees.
11008,"Howard Schultz is an asshole. Just another ""Look at me, I'm above petty partisanship, all I want is more tax cuts for rich people like me."""
11009,Gtfo Schultz. 
11010,Is he still here? I'm surprised he didn't use some coffee metaphor 
11011,Fuck this guy and his shitty coffee.
11012,Howard Schultz thinking he can run an an Independent is a sad spectacle.
11013,Not as sad a spectacle as Schultz's candidacy.
11014,He really wants to be seen as something more than just a coffee slinger.
11015,Takes one to know one
11016,Why is this guy still around?
11017,Is this dope still babbling?
11018,Does he not realize that people can find better coffee elsewhere these days?
11019,As sad as your burnt coffee? I don’t think so.
11020,Hasn't Starbucks stock been rising since he started pretending he has a chance of winning.
11021,This is like Pacific Rim except for billionaires.
11022,Fuck you Howard.
11023,"What, if anything, did Schultz have to say about the Bengazi hearings? Or all the votes to repeal the ACA? Or anything which occurred prior to the current Congress?"
11024,"Schultz is just a Republican cosplaying as an enlightened centrist. 

Fuck off. "
11025,"""Right wing billionaire pretending to be liberal says dumb thing.""

Fuck off Shultz. Anyone supporting this asshole is dumber than a rock."
11026,"Who cares, if anything he'll steal 2 or 3% of the vote from Trump. The only people he could win over are never Trump republicans that would never vote democrat and aren't liberal enough socially to back Weld, Hogan or whatever libertarian candidate is running. "
11027,"> Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Schultz, saying that the hearing was important oversight that ""showed the vibrancy of our democracy."" 

>”Dear @HowardSchultz: You don't get it, do you? This week showed the vibrancy of our democracy,"" he tweeted. ""The Cohen hearing showed what happens when Congress conducts actual oversight.""

I’m pretty much ready for Lieu 2020, though his profile isn’t high enough yet.  Come 2028 though..."
11028,"Stop, Schultz. You won't even make it past the primary"
11029,"“Why is Howard Schultz on every television in the country? Why are you quoting Howard Schultz? Because he’s a billionaire. There are a lot of people I know personally who work hard for a living and make forty, fifty thousand dollars a year that know a lot more about politics than Mr Schultz. But because we have a corrupt political system, anybody who is a billionaire, who can throw a lot of ads on television, suddenly becomes credible.“"
11030,"Because without him, 2020 would be an absolute rout for the Democratic candidate, and the media needs there to be some uncertainty in the outcome to attract eyeballs and therefore add revenue?"
11031,Right?
11032,Is that a potato chip with dip on top?
11033,He would never win especially as an independent. No one needs to argue why he should or shouldn’t be president. He already lost the general. The only question is how many concerned centrists he’s going to siphon.
11034, I think the best thing is to stop giving him attention
11035,">""Save my tax cuts by slashing the social safety net!""

That's it.  That's the whole platform."
11036,"According to Schultz, they're ""people of means, "" not ""billionaires."""
11037,"His platform is to undermine progressives. You'll notice the first thing he did when announcing his potential run, wasn't to attack Trump, it was to attack Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. 

He's actually said very little about Trump. 

He declared which democrats he'd be happy with, and those are the democrats he knows won't really change anything fundamental about how the power structure in Washington works."
11038,"Like most third party candidates, his plan is to appeal to the people who just lazily say ""everything sucks"" instead of trying to understand the world and what's happening in it."
11039,Only he does.
11040,“I would never sell the Seattle SuperSonics to a group from Oklahoma “-Howard Schultz 
11041,Dunkin donuts has better coffee
11042,Exactly! Go away and take Starbucks with you. 
11043,Beat me to the punch. 
11044,I sold at 69.50 right around the time he announced. It's currently at 70.68.  So while true the overall market has actually gone up more since then. 
11045,"Thank you is what he had to say. 

Thank you for the tax cuts. Notice he hasn’t said anything bad about Trump and is totally not willing to talk about tax cuts. "
11046,Ted Lieu was born in Taiwan and is not eligible for the presidency. 
11047,"he has no intention of making it past the primaries, or even participating in them for that fact. He just intends to run as a 3rd party spoiler candidate if Democrats nominate anybody that would raise his taxes or start holding ""people of means"" accountable for their fuckery. He's just a giant douche bag that no one should be paying any mind. "
11048,"He'd run as an independent to take votes from the Democratic nominee. He may even be daft enough to believe he could win. As I see it, he might have a remote shot at a plurality in a few states, but his best possible showing would mean no candidate had 270 Electors. At that point the House of Representatives, ***voting by state***, would elect the President, and Schultz having no party so no Representatives behind him would likely lose, except that he may believe he'd be the lesser of evils for both parties.

OTOH, if Schultz were to win in the House of Representatives, at least that might augur a diminution of presidential power, which would be a good thing. Then he could be electorally annihilated in 2024 for being the weakest POTUS in living memory."
11049,"Exactly. They're not interested in politics, only the rating which come from the entertainment of a spectacle. This system of covering politics as if it were a sporting event is a plague upon all our houses.

Schultz is basically a wet dream for the media and pundit class because he combination of wealth and the celebrity status which vicariously flows from it, not to mention the open derision he receives as result of his ideological positions. Kinda reminds me of exactly what happened with one of GOP candidates last presidential cycle."
11050,Such disrespect to potato chips. 
11051,Not cool man. Potato chips don't deserve this.
11052,"We prefer to be called Money-Americans, get it right! - Schultz, probably"
11053,"True, I thought it was more than that. But I can't help but feel like being up 5% over the last three months and hovering near an annual high is connected to the publicity from his run."
11054,From his POV it's the badmouthing of tax cuts which is precisely what's wrong with the current Democratic Party.
11055,That’s a shame.  Oh well.  Maybe he can unseat Feinstein.
