If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.

Not much to misunderstand from that. 
"
130,"First, that's from the Old Testament and thus isn't applicable because the New Testament is what counts. This is Christianity 101.

Second, back then culturally if a woman was violated before marriage she would end up homeless, not desired, extremely poor, etc. What you quoted is a way for that woman to avoid that nightmare. The payment as a fine and then he would have to support her for her entire life was cultural protection. This is also completely dependent on whether her father would permit her to marry (Exodus 22:17). And the man can never divorce her no matter what she does."

For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

I'm Conservative and I'm voting for Trump. There are many like me. Maybe Cruz supporters wake up and realize what's at stake. But if getting Conservatives behind Trump is that important, there are other candidates that would do the job better, like Sessions or even Rand Paul. And if you go with Rand Paul, a lot of young Libertarians might jump ship from Gary Johnson over to Trump.

> What state swing state or even a blue state will Newt help us win? Trump will dominate key swing states regardless

That's a long way of saying ""none"". A candidate that could help us win a swing state or a blue state has a lot more value than one who cannot.

>You know was speaker of the house and balanced the fucking budget. The man would destroy in the debates. He is wise, experienced and knowledgeable.

I'll give him credit for passing a balanced budget especially with a Democrat as president, although I don't think that's a good enough reason to pick him over other candidates. 

>How does Newt fit in with Trump's agenda or at least half his views? That will take more time to answer than it is worth. They don't see eye to eye 100%, no one ever does.

There are very few things that they do see eye-to-eye on. He's a Globalist, war hawk who's part of the GOPe. Even if Trump's VP pick doesn't agree with him on everything, why not go with a candidate who's on board with the Trump Train and hasn't bad-mouthed Trump?

188,Thanks for the dialogue.  I like him.  Many hate him.  
189,"Gingrich was also the Speaker when Republicans finally took control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years back during the Clinton regime. He's not clean and pure, but FFS we're going against Clinton here. El Chapo looks like a saint compared to that monster.

Gingrich could potentially be the to Trump as Biden is to Obama - there to handle the political and procedural machinations of Washington that the presidential candidate is simply unaware of, and gives people a sense of comfort knowing that the new guy isn't going in entirely blind.

Plus Gingrich will devour anyone in the VP debate, which is nice."

196,"You're right--they don't vote solely based on a VP, but I think you underestimate the impact it could have. I think Cruz supporters would be a lot more inclined to vote for Trump than they are now if a guy like Sessions or Rand Paul were the pick.

Another example: John McCain wasn't doing well with Conservatives until he announced Sarah Palin as his VP. 

A VP should be someone that fills a gap or helps win a key demographic / voter bloc. "
197,Rather in the woods high as fuck than in their palaces stone cold sober.
198,"Very true.  I see better options for Trump, but I trust his judgement with whoever he picks.  Gingrich has been on Hannity multiple times saying, in abstract terms, that he's certain he won't be the VP pick.

Only a few more weeks before the big reveal.  Here's to hoping that the final pick is better than we've all previously imagined."
199,"I agree, let's trust his judgment. The guy knows a lot more than any of us and knows what he's doing. If he thinks Newt's the best candidate, I'm with him 100%."

201,"Really? I think Eboni failed. She just admitted that the fact that the unborn is a human life is irrelevant which is Ben's point. That is an unethical standpoint all throughout history. 

Pro choicers in the nineties said fetuses weren't lives which was scientifically false, then they said they weren't human which is scientifically false, now they have to say they aren't persons which is the exact argument of a slaveholder or a Nazi.

So what Eboni Williams is saying here is that while both human, one has more rights than the other. That is egregiously unethical."

220,I don't believe it. Just propaganda to attack his decision making abilities and to discredit the VP
221,I don't buy it. He had no obligation to declare his VP so early.

251,"Probably, but then I would die sometime in the late 1800s or early 1900s because slavery ended 130 years ago."
252,"Slavery was made illegal for over 130 years. If you're getting angry over something that happened that long ago and was already rectified, then you're part of the problem.

Get over it. Every major nation 300 years ago was keeping slaves; Europe was keeping slaves, Asia was keeping slaves, everyone. 

What make Black people special and cool over other ethnicity? Most of them can't even speak their traditional African languages for crying out loud.

I also have seen Black people calling racist remarks to Asians as well, and I can guarantee you that those remarks are worse than what normal White people can say about you guys."
253,"I'm Australian, my ancestors were brought to this country to work as slaves for the British colonists. I harbor no resentment to the British. Irish children were brought to America as slaves, should the Irish be compensated for their slavery? If a father commits a crime, should the son have to pay for that crime? If black people kill white cops today, to white cops get to kill black people tomorrow? What is the point you are trying to make here.

If your goal is to point out the horrible inequalities and injustices that have been placed on black communities to keep them poor and uneducated, predominantly by the Democratic party and the hypocritically ignorant left, then I would whole heartedly agree with you. I would further suggest to remedy the situation that we elect a non establishment candidate, who has been a leader in workplace diversity and equality for over two decades, namely Donald Trump."
254,"Let's think: Slavery started in 1650s and ended in 1860s.  That was well over 150 years ago.  And yet, people still want to bring it up?  In truth, it's a person's mentality that keeps them in slavery.  If a young black person manages to even get born (36% of all abortions are of black babies, or roughly a quarter of a million), then 27% of them will be born into poverty - the highest of any group.  Naturally, with poverty is a poor education.  Due to the culture they are born into, women are seen as nothing more than sex objects and men are not men unless they have a gun to shoot people with.  Children are simply a way to get extra money on a welfare check.  Granted, this isn't true for all of that 27%, but it is true for enough that it is sickening.  Now, if you manage to not get shot (93% of all Black murders are committed by someone who is also black.  These murders account for 50% of the entire murder rate in the USA), you also have a much lower live expectancy anyway.  So why doesn't the black community look inward to prevent murder and killing rather than blaming what is somewhat of a scapegoat?  After all, if you survive not being killed by your mother, not being killed by your brother (black on black murder), but you are going to freak out over 30% of 1000+ death by cop?   It's a scapegoat and little more.  "
255,"Yup and the narrative is already being written that the cop shot the guy before he knew that the 'gun' pulled on him by the suspect was perhaps only a toy, or a 'cell phone case'. But, it doesn't matter, the suspect is white so BLM won't care, extremist liberals won't care, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton won't care. "

264,"1) Picking a politico gives power to the politicians realm. Puts focus on typical left/right divide issues, in a way that say picking a general would put the focus on foreign policy. This wouldn't be terrrible except

2) Pence is social conservative. If the focus goes to left/right divide this is a huge weakness, hillarys campaign would be quite competitive in getting the center

368,How fucking dense is New York? I guess they just don't give a fuck as long as their money machine (Wall Street) keeps churning. 
369,if hillary was running as from a different state trump would have a fighting chance...shillary is officially 'from NY' even though she's a fucking carpetbagger who used NY to become a senator. so she's running as a 'new yorker' who used to be senator-NY and sec of state (from NY)...
370,"Same reason why London voted heavily for remain, they thrive off of globalism. It's why Bernie also never had a chance there."
371,I don't think it's because of the NY connection because Trump is as NY as it gets. In fact I bet more people know who Trump is/what he does than what Hillary actually does aside from being a former president's wife. I think it's more that NY is heavily Democratic and has a lot of liberal types in NYC in particular (a city that has more ppl in it than many entire states do). 
372,carpetbagger is a term for northerners who came south in post civil-war reconstruction.  Hillary is a southern who went north to exploit one of the highest concentrations of partisan cucks in the country.
373,Trump is a typical NY Republican.   But there are twice as many Dems in the state.  That's a big difference to overcome.   It'll depend on how disgusted they'll be with the Clinton corruption and crimes.

This is the first time i've ever come across this problem and I refuse to go any further with it.  If he posted it to imgur than linked it to imgur how did it end up in a file format that required a download?
406,"Because your browser doesn't support it. 

As a format, it's only been around for like, 6 years? Facebook posts occasionally use it, so it's not out of the blue. Firefox just announced support is being planned like, 3 months ago.. He probably posted it like that because it's literally a file type, and he didn't want to go through a converter.. 

But here.

412,"This is the entire fucking point of the constitution saying that all powers not expressly granted the federal government fall to the states by default.   The federal government works best when it has the least amount of power possible.   For example,  there should be no department of education (I don't want faggots from California/rednecks from the south/cubans in Florida having any say in what my Philadelphia ghetto kids are learning about the world),  no irs (we should have about a 15% flat tax with no deductions or loopholes),  no FEMA (there should be a 'disaster czar' who coordinates the FBI,  military, and local law enforcement during a crisis), no VA (active duty military should tend to veterans),  etc.

Plus, while Trump may say some things that are a bit cringe worthy, you can't argue with results.  The man is a freaking genius.  He picks fights with the media just to get them to fall into his trap, and give him millions in free air time.  I've never seen someone play the media with so much finesse, even if he looks awkward while he's doing it.  I want a man like that nimbly navigating the geopolitical landscape."

503,"Ok a lot of people are giving you crap, which i can understand since this isn't a sub Reddit for asking questions, but I'll answer it sincerely. 

Anyone who pays less taxes using legal loopholes should no be blamed for paying less taxes. That applies to any income bracket. Trump has publicly paid 0 to low income taxes and no one has arrested him for tax fraud so we can only assume he's done so legally. Thus, he is smart. He worked the system politicians made and got the best deal. It's a great example of how he understands our economic structure and where the loopholes are. He also has clearly stated in a tax plan how he intends to fix it. 

However if someone plays with taxes illegally and pays less, that's not okay. People like to frame the stance on taxes as only caring about the rich and screw the poor. That's not the case. In fact, Trump WANTS the poor to pay less- 0% income tax on his lowest of 4 brackets. "
504,"Very skewed polls. He's tied in two national polls and down by 5 (in the margin) of one. Plus, very competitive in the swing states and it's only June. This month was one of the hardest for his campaign while Hillary probably had her best and he's still tied with her. For comparison, Romney was down a lot at this point. "
505,"Article is misleading, Trump just wants to protect the bill of rights, like he always has. This includes religious liberty, freedom of speech, and the 2nd amendment.

Trump hasn't published any policy specifics (which will be pointless until he gets into office and studies the issues hands on).

But I haven't heard anything anti Immigrant coming from Trump, only from a small subgroup of fellow Trump supporters. 

I believe Trump is against lack immigration enforcement, illegal immigration and the importation of large groups of state dependant groups that lack ability to integrate culturally and economically.

So if your girlfriend fails to get an H1B, it's because the current system allows TATA, InfoSys and a bunch of other Indian software consultancies (i.e. body shops) to lock 85% of the allocated visas.

So take it from an immigrant previously on an H1B visa - the current system sucks balls for legal immigrants like me, and soon your gf, and Trump is the only candidate who can even attempt to fix the system."

Trump explains on his website how Mexico will pay for the wall in a multitude of ways.  As far why... the obvious is to protect our citizens, make it fair to legal immigrants, and not have us pay a fortune for illegal immigrants (113 BILLION a year I believe and rising).  Drugs, human, and sex trafficking pour across the border and it's never been higher.  When criminals are caught, they are let go in OUR country 80% of the time.  And as far as monetary concerns, all the money saved would go to Americans in the form of rebuilding schools, inner cities, etc.  Illegal immigrants also make it exponentially harder for legal immigrats, legal Latinos, and legal African Americans to get jobs which they are all competing for.  So that means lots of legal citizens resort to the welfare lifestyle, which costs us WAYYYY more.  So there are a lot of solid and clear reasons why we'd want to protect our border.

Now is it efficient?  Look at Israel's border... 2,000+ illegals a month to 2... yes, TWO a month.  Hungary and many other countries built walls and are having great success.  Walls aren't racist."
762,Because people are being raped daily by the border.

764,"Well just consider the fact that last week there was a guy deported five times who on his sixth visit (illegally) to our country he raped and murdered some woman then today it was on front page of r/the_Donald, some guy shot two people on his fifth visit (illegally). With a strong wall and all the fixings (microphones to detect sound, laser tech to detect heat) we will have better control of keeping people out that we don't want in. This is really something that should have been addressed at the begining of our country but it's never too late.

Every life matters right? So let's get this out of the way now before this country falls into a debt crisis that it can't handle. Also it will create some infrastructure jobs in the long term cuz this wall won't be built that fast idc what Donald says lol."

For example, Canada is still a constitutional monarchy while the US is a republic. Then, there's the issue of Quebec and its autonomy. In a US-Canada merger, Anglophones become the overwhelming majority, which could be seen as a bad thing for Quebec. Canada also uses the Metric system while the US largely does not. In terms of population, Canada only has 30-35 million people while the US has ~320 million people. So any system of proportional representation would heavily favor the Americans. 

Even if both nations gave each other open borders without merging, both nations would have to come to a consensus about external border control. Refugee policy is another point of contention as Canada has admitted thousands of Syrian refugees."

First, cuck is used pejoratively across the Internet.  We certainly use it a lot, but a LOT of political sites use it, and it's pretty commonplace on many forums/websites - probably just not the ones you're going to.  

Second, it is a derisive term, because it refers to someone letting someone else fuck their wife.  The implication is that someone is so weak that someone else has to give their wife the dick.

But let's bring it home. You literally encouraged people to donate to a candidate that not only lost, lost hard, to an utterly corrupt candidate, who now has his money and his supporters and will openly flout the major tenets of his campaign:

992,He's a provocateur 
993,no never
994,out out out
995,"So he's a bitchy queen...so fucking what? He admits that openly and honestly.

He is a brilliant speaker with a sharp tongue and he is really fucking good at it. He has a unique and valuable ability to frame the discussion to highlight important issues using impactful rhetorical devices. He is a master debator, able to flip the script on Leftist propogandists in the media live, on-air, in the middle of the interview.

We would be absolute fools to reject this Nimble verbal assassin."
996,So he's basically akin then in quality to a 13 year old. There's nothing intelligent or subtle about it

998,Really. He's no where near a master debater. He just says common sense it's not hard. Dawkins is closer to a master debater 
999,"Really, more than anything, this is about a united front. Take a page from the success of the Left and use their tactics against them. We don't turn against our allies or we shoot ourselves in the foot."
1000,He's a classical liberal he has admitted that. Also not shooting our allies we have been attacking people on the right all the time
1001,"That's a fair point.

I encourage us to stop that and unify, at least until the Right has risen to power. Then, and only then, may we have the free discussion of the finer points of policy and implementation.

Stay on-target, Centipede!"
1002,Very well unity and then we'll see in 2017
1003,I look forward to the vigorous debate to come =)

Trump speaks at a 4th grade level so that he can talk to everyone.  It's a campaign strategy.  

The idea that a Mexican judge couldn't *potentially* be biased against Trump, because he wants to build a wall, is absurd.  The point of the justice system is to ensure a fair trial.  The judge should have recused himself to avoid even the question of bias.  Innocent until proven guilty and all that.  

Lol, America has never been great?  What the fuck?  The most democratic, freest, most economically successful nation in the history of the world was never great.  Okay.   This kid is a fucking joke.

2.  Trump had no idea who the guy was, had met him once years ago, here is a video of Trump mocking Cruz the same way.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4604reEqk0

3.  John McCain said some nasty things about him, he said that McCain was a hero but only because he cot captured.  Not the nicest thing to say, but i'm not voting on which candidate says the nicest things.  

4.  The judge is a member of a lawyers organization with direct ties to La Raza a hispanic supremacy group.  He is also a member of a hispanic only organization that has called for a total boycott on donald trump.  If a judge was a member of a group that was boycotting you would you think you could get a fair trial.  Probably not.  Once again he could have said it in a nicer manner.  If having the president saying things in a nice manner is the most important thing to you, please vote for the corrupt candidate that has committed perjury.

1409,"The libertarian candidates have always been velcro sneaker wearing whisper loud talkers who have one great idea - Make Gov Smaller - and Trump is God Emperor because he is basically the living Batman for spending his fortune to put his life in danger and constant work to make our country safe AND reduce size of gov as much as possible- not as much as the Libers, but they're not gonna get it done still."
1410,"That's like predicating an argument on gravity not being real.  Why would you start a discussion from a non-factual premise? =P

In all seriousness - giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you're not a shill - you seem to be asking for something that already exists. The Trump campaign always has been a broad church. From the beginning his messages and policies have appealed to libertarians, nationalists, disenfranchised liberals tired with SJWism, centrists and conservatives alike. Beyond that, as flairs indicate, his message appeals to people the world over. From Europe to Australia, from Japan to the mighty USA.

What you're asking for exists and has from the beginning. What else would you have the_donald - which is, worth remembering, a shitpost haven and meme-magic factory, nothing more - do?"
1411,"I understand the sentiments, OP, but if I can make an analogy, /r/The_Donald is a walled city where centipedes encourage one another, protect their young, regroup from external battles, debunk the media's beguiling word-twisting, and prepare for the next onslaught of lies and attacks from without. We already do hear everyone with a voice *outside* these hallowed halls -- some here interact with them daily -- this does not mean we must invite those same voices into our sanctuary: We are not a unitarian universalist congregation, to speak metaphorically.  
&nbsp;  
Let me remind you of our big, beautiful door: Outside these shining gates, /r/AskTrumpSupporters is the universal mission zone for debate, discussion, and dissent. If honest dissenters wish to invite /r/The_Donald readers to a multi-view-point discussion *outside* the city gates, the best way to do this is to start a thread on /r/AskTrumpSupporters and then alert /r/The_Donald folks to join you by directly linking to the discussion. Links to /r/AskTrumpSupporters are encouraged here, and doing this will make the moderators' enforcement jobs much more do-able for both subreddits. We could definitely use more activity on /r/AskTrumpSupporters among centipedes, anyways.  
&nbsp;  
For /r/The_Donald however, high walls and enforced laws are eternally necessary to prevent destruction and crime within the city; to ask the moderators to adopt a more open-borders policy would be to incur a thousandfold increase in their workload on this large and active sovereign community. Discerning between dissenting debate from shilling is extremely time-consuming, and like illegal immigration, holds comparatively more harm than benefit to the well-being of the city-state. It is fraught with deleterious consequences, not the least of which is a pernicious dilution of the critically important political values this community presently holds with unity -- such as truth, justice, and everything Trump.  
&nbsp;  
That's my perspective on these two subreddits, but I defer to those, including yourself, who have been here longer.  "

1417,"Agreed... but that doesn't clarify your point. What is it exactly you're asking of The_Donald, as a community, with your post?

If you're suggesting that this domreddit should soften its tone so as to appear more moderate and welcoming to outsiders, as you seem to be, I think you're shit out of luck. As the King himself says, why should we change a winning strategy? As stated, people from all across the political spectrum have been drawn in regardless of - and often precisely FOR - the bantz. Why change?

1418,"Hillary is toast. Bernie knew about it, which is why he conceeded prior to the DNC.  He's lost credibility. Forget about the Democratic party, it's toast.  Soros is the puppet master. We know, as Trump supporters, that Donald cannot be bought, Donald cannot be stumped. You, however, do not have that comfort level with Gary and Jill. In order to defeat Trump, they must become beholden to Soros to get that money before Nov 7th. Ain't gonna happen the honest way.

If a company sells say, 80% of all of its products to USA, slapping a huge tariff on them to import to USA is actually going to cost them more money than they would save by moving offshore and they cant just decide not to export to USA, they lose most of their profits.

Stopping drugs coming into the country and actually doing something on the supposed ""war on drugs"" that we've been in forever with the Wall is a big plus.

Taking politics back from the grip of the media [like for instance the owner of amazon buying up newspapers so he can spread favorable publicity about putting companies out of business while he dodges taxes]

But I think the most important thing is Trump's attitude. People don't like his hair, his self promotion, the fact that he is successful. Fuck them. Those are not real issues or reasons to dislike anybody. SJWs are trying to take over the country and make everyone's life miserable and unlivable, because that's what chronically depressed and psychologically deranged people do. Trump is strong enough to stand up to people like this, and lead others to do the same. We're not just making america great again, we're making it normal, for people who like to enjoy life and have fun

Trump is extremely articulate and well put together. His congressional testimony about the UN renovations for example. He's had some very interesting ideas about tax policy, years ago he suggested a one time tax to pay off the national debt.

1. Trump and Sanders, on most issues, are polar opposites. Although there may be some common ground, it's way too little for them to work together.
2. The protests. When you have people showing up at Trump events wearing Bernie gear, or claiming in the media to be Bernie supporters, and doing things like burning flags, assaulting Trump supporters, committing vandalism, calling Trump a ""Nazi"", etc. that kinda blew it for you guys. Trump supporters would NEVER stand for a combined Trump/Sanders ticket at this point, and I'm sure Trump knows that.
