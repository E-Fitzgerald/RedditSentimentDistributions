How long will we defend Trump? Forever. The left has been defending Obama and Hillary after years of lies, treason, & betrayal to the American ppl. You want Trump supporters to abandon him for what? Calling a spade a spade? Trying to build a relationship w Pakistan then realizing it's a worthless effort? GFY.

We will stop defending him when he sends billions of our cash to our enemy, lies to us about a YouTube video causing 4 deaths of Americans & then following up by locking up the American who made video, when he weaponizes the IRS against American citizens who do not agree w him, when he gives thousands of guns to drug cartels while gun grabbing from the US citizens...the list goes on and on, so to make it simple we will stop supporting him if he becomes like traitor POS Obama and Crooked Corrupt Hillary.

One lives and dies by the sword. Bannon fucked up Alabama. Gloria DialARapeAccusation helped and in some ways it's brutal on Bannon but it's a brutal world, I'm afraid, and ole' Trump has shown a propensity to punish failure harshly. That's all there is to it. If Roy Moore had won we wouldn't be here. The base will not split - no Bannonites are suddenly going to abandon Trump - *unless* Trump lapses on immigration, DACA and the wall... at which point it won't just be Bannonites but probably 90%+ of Trumpites who will jump ship so that's a moot point anyway.

TL;DR: If anything this makes mid-terms easier. We saw the drama the mixed messages created in Alabama. Imagine if in the Mid-Terms Trump and Bannon had broken ranks on 5 or 6 different seats. Could've been disastrous. Now there is a singular voice - the right voice - guiding the base: Trump. It's a shrewd, ""postmortem of Alabama"" decision and I think very wise.

201,"There was a poster used by Britain during the war, simple but to the point...KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON!!"
202,"Again, there are often things going on behind the scenes we can't know.

On the face of it, it looks like Bannon is a clown. However, we know we can't trust anyone in  the fake news, like the author of this book. So Bannon  could be OK, could be trolling or LARPing.

[I reserve judgment](https://www.buddhagroove.com/zen-story-cause-and-effect/) because there is no need to do anything at this point, except focus on other stuff, and there are plenty of other things to focus on which are way more important."
203,"Whether this is a lie, 50 D chess, or just Bannon caught complaining in the heat of the moment, GEOTUS has exceeded my expectations and I am loyal to him always. Checked in with MAGA family and friends and they love Trump more each day!"
204,"I have no idea what is going on with him, it's weird and the timing is weird but if it's accurate then so be it. I didn't vote for him. It's not like all the sudden I'm going to change my opinion of Trump. Also the whole book is full of a lot of b.s. apparently like Trump really didn't want to win and Melania was scream crying when he did, etc. Please. The man was doing 24/7 rallies. So that alone makes me highly suspicious of anything else in the book. That said Trump and co have thrown him under the bus so I guess until further notice it's true and that's a bummer,  but life goes on. Maybe down the road we will understand more about this but right now who cares, we got to MAGA and I don't see how this complaining on his part helps achieve that so he's dead to me right now. "

207,"It's backstabbing. Remember what happens to people who try to fuck with Trump. Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, now Steve Bannon. And you are right, Bannon is a fundamentalist just like the left are fundamentalists"

212,"Has Trump done anything wrong yet? No. Don’t borrow trouble. If we get bad news on DACA, we’ll deal with it but the clock is ticking for Congress and if they screw it up, Trump can send them home whenever he wants."
213,"In the past I never really knew what a concern troll was, but here one is!"
214,"There is no meaningful policy terms - no moral questions or value judgments either - upon which ""Bannonites"" and ""Trumpites"" are in noteworthy disagreement. There isn't a vector along which they *could* split and fracture apart. What separates them is a willingness to compromise and be pragmatic.

What is actually more probable than a ""split"" - in my view - is that *if* Trump were to hypothetically cuck on his core campaign principle of the wall and immigration reform you'd see ALL Trumpites and Bannonites abandon Trump and all of *both* groups - Trumpites and Bannonites alike - swing *way* further to the right in furious, ""we should REALLY think hard about taking up arms"" desperation.

TL;DR: If Trump cucks on the wall don't expect the base to split... expect to see them become Alt-Right and white nationalism to become mainstream in the United States like the left are already pretending it is.  "
215,We do but nope. It is weird though I will give you that. But the whole Moore situation was weird too... I am leaning more to thinking that guy is going to turn out to actually have been a dodged bullet. So maybe there is something to that.
216,"I'll do my best as I haven't read it, but for one thing it's not actually Bannon's book it's by a NY author who has written some questionable books in the past but also at least one pretty good book (about Rupert Murdoch I think). It just quotes Bannon. What I know I mostly heard on Howie Carr today so unfortunately can't give you links, but in addition to the very very questionable claims in the book that Trump didn't actually want to win and that Melania was freaking out the night he did, it is also claimed by a former staffer (can't remember which one) that Trump didn't recognize Boehner when he walked in for an interview (I mean, maybe, but he is pretty recognizable and Trump has tweeted about him like a dozen times), is semi-literate and never reads (again if you are liberal you eat this up but really?? He graduated top of his class from Wharton. And they said the exact same thing about Bush, always with the no reading) and that in addition to not wanting to win, when he DID win, he and the entire room including Don Jr were shell shocked and like deer in headlights for a while. Oh, apparently Bannon also is quoted or at least there is a heresay quote from someone that heard Bannon say that Trump would love to hire some dude that had just been taken out of contention for some position because he had chased some woman around. Which I could actually see that one, maybe being a joke,  who knows. Book does sound juicy like Howie said but there's an awful lot of really suspect shit and like, convenient revelations (for the left) right off the bat. It's odd. I hope this made sense, trying to type on my phone here... again these are all reports about what is in this book. "

She’s been saying for almost a year now that they’re all going down for money laundering. Most likely involving Russian organized crime. Before Trump fired Preet Bhara, he was investigating Russian money laundering via the New York real estate market. Collusion during the election is small potatoes compared to that.

Preet got fired the same day that all other 55 attorneys general got fired. "
241,"Also trump is screwing Russia in Syria and Iran and he's backing Ukraine with arms still. He's no friend of Putin, and since Putin is president he is the leader of Russian organized crime. Which means trump isn't helping those he supposedly got all these deals with. "

I had to change doctors because the new doctors didn't take my new insurance after the forced swap. The last year I had interest in getting insurance I had 1 option for a provider and my premium was over 1000 dollars for just myself and the deductible was so high I would never meet it.

Also Vox isn't a reputable source. Vox is pure propaganda. I could care less about anything they have to say.  I am not sure what OP expects to find here as far as answers.  There are so many variables that are unknown with the story told in the video.

Look OP, I am a person who was born at around 2 lbs. I spent my life in and out of hospitals. My dad worked hard and his company provided insurance that helped to save my life. Now, that insurance is no longer around for people who need it because of Obama Care. If anything Obama care killed people because had that existed when I was a kid my dad would have lost his insurance.  His take home pay would have excluded him from the cheaper market options and wouldn't have been able to afford to keep all of us insured.  He would have lost everything trying to keep me alive.  So while the kid in the video would have lived, I would have died.

Making an assertion about a man's beliefs, especially when such an outrageous claim, with no supporting evidence, or evidence that is tenuous *in the extreme*, such that it doesn't hold up to the simplest of rigor, is a liberal argument hallmark.

Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. Especially a claim as easy to make, and as damaging to a person's character and reputation, as ""racism.""

679,"Take away the labels on the chart, which are fake (Obama was president for almost the entire blue portion) and then point out that the line in the red Trump part is decreasing faster than the Obama line.

Usually unemployment rates flat line as they get lower because there are fewer people looking for work and those who are still out of work generally have a reason. Yet, despite unemployment being the lowest its been in 20 years, it is dropping even faster under Trump than under Obama.

In just a year, and with unprecedented opposition, Trump has bettered Obama's best economic numbers despite Obama starting from basically rock bottom and having supermajorities when he took office."

Trump has clear policies that he has implemented (reducing regulations, reducing corporate taxes) that are clearly making businesses a healthier environment. 

Obama's 'unemployment' doesn't tell the story that those jobs were often under their skillset and below their pay expectations. I would like to hear people tell me what Obama did for the economy. 

The graph is a result of a natural recovery from the 2008 recession, and Obama only slowed down the recovery. I mean, look at how long it took to get back to the unemployment numbers of 2008. "

The actual term assault rifle as classified by the government is a silly definition to begin with. 

It has nothing to do with the rate of fire or caliber of the round. 

More deaths occur from young men killing each other with firearms, suicides by firearm and domestic violence with a firearm. 

Far more than mass shooting at schools. 

So you come around here when a school shooting happens infers that those other deaths don’t matter.

The US constitution does not grant us any rights, Inalienable rights from God was the basis of our country and were the primary difference between the American founders and Britain. The Constitution does not grant any rights; all language in it indicates that rights shall be protected or not infringed upon; bc they already exist

America is unique in the world as we recognize that rights exist in nature. Other countries ""create"" them by law and thus they can be taken away by law.

If a right exists in nature it can never be taken away. We have the 2A in case govt decides to attack our natural rights"

1314,"Again, please consider replacing ""second"" with ""first."" There are a lot of things we could do to make life safer, including banning political protests, free speech (i.e. ""hate speech"" from the KKK), cars, unhealthy foods, etc. I think it goes without saying you wouldn't want to ban all of those things, despite the fact guns kill about 34,000 people annually while heart disease alone (stemming from the unhealthy foods, most likely) kills about 610,000. My point here is that nobody wants to child-proof life, because it results in a society in which no free American would want to live.

As it stands, my slippery slope argument could be used to justify having no government regulation at all, and I recognize that this too is a bad idea. So the question is: what level of protection do you build into society via legislation? The framers opted to shift the balance away from safety and towards freedom, as summarized in the famous ""those who would trade liberty for a little temporary safety..."" quote. One of the freedoms they gave us is the freedom to own guns. You may say it's archaic or anachronistic, but surely it is less so than your Third Amendment protection against the quartering of soldiers in your home, a practice legalized by the British Quartering Act of 1765. Both the Second and Third Amendments are important because of the principles behind the literal reading of the words. The framers believed that God, nature, or whatever you prefer to call it, intrinsically gives us the right to life, liberty, and property. The Second Amendment is a reflection of the belief in the right to property. And so yes, they believed that protecting this right was worth making daily life a little less safe.

Would I give my life for the Second Amendment? When you put it that way, I think anyone would say no. But would you give your life for free speech? I hope not, because then it would mean an end to your free speech anyway. This is a false dichotomy. There's a tradeoff here. You're not giving up your life for the Second Amendment. You're giving up some degree of safety in exchange for more liberty. And like it or not, this is the tradeoff that the framers made on your behalf."

1328,"Thanks for providing some specific suggestions. This is something I don't often get from liberals. Indeed, the usual outcry is in favor of nebulous ""gun control"" laws (which already exist) and a ban on ""assault weapons"" (which aren't even a defined category of guns). These are at least some suggestions I can work with. Following are my thoughts on this.

>  complete and thorough background checks, including an interview...possibly a month or two

Well, we already have background checks. I don't think even the NRA would object to making them complete and thorough, as there is no point to incomplete background checks. The interview and the possibility of a month-long wait time is where things get dicey though. Let's consider another Constitutionally protected right: suffrage. Right now, many state legislatures are debating an ID requirement for voting. Courts sometimes bar this requirement because it allegedly places an undue burden to voting, and because it amounts to a poll tax. If presenting an ID is an undue burden, then what could be said of an interview? Going to an interview requires driving somewhere potentially far from one's residence, which constitutes an expense. But more important is that it requires time off during the workday. I'm a professional with a PhD and a job in scientific research, and even with my flexible work hours it's nontrivial to dedicate time during the workday to do something like this. I can scarcely imagine how someone would go to an interview who works in fast food or some other industry where employers are less flexible. The problem isn't limited to lower income people. I have friends who are resident physicians who can't take time off work without months-long advanced notice to their supervisors. One would be hard pressed to see the interview requirement as anything short of an undue burden.

As to the possibility of months-long wait times, this is a requirement that isn't even imposed on licensure to operate motor vehicles - something that is not a Constitutionally protected right. Indeed, given that Muslims are now committing acts of terror by driving cars into crowds of people, an interview might be a good idea before granting driver's licenses. Again, it seems like an undue burden to place on a right enshrined in the Constitution.

> Maybe a police visit every 2 years to inspect the condition of the guns, where they are kept, and the family situation also.

This seems like a great idea if the practice in question isn't a basic right of all American citizens. The state subjects people to this level of scrutiny before letting them foster children, but if it were applied to gun ownership it would seem a lot like a violation of Fourth Amendment protections of security of one's person and house. Also, consider how many people in America own guns. An overburdened government wouldn't be able to do this quickly, which again raises my objection against the undue burden.

> In terms of the fact that ~90% of guns used for crimes are bought illegally, I think this amount would drop significantly as people realise that if they decide to sell a gun on illegally, they would be found out soon enough when the police take their next inspection. Any missing guns that weren't reported should be grounds for prosecution.

Setting aside the last sentence for a moment, this is a great suggestion. It's already tautologically illegal to illegally sell a gun. I hate to quote the NRA's oft-used phrase, but why not enforce existing law more vigorously here? Start policing illegally selling of firearms more harshly, and criminally prosecute people who illegally sell guns that are later used in crimes.

The problem here is the unreported missing guns. Letting the state enter my home to inspect my property violates my right to be secure in my home. It may make people safer, but is it worth turning America into a police state where gun inspectors can enter your home at their discretion?"

1347,"""Mild-mannered"" is meaningless to me. I don't know you and you don't know me. It's my opinion you don't really know a person until you've seen them when they're angry.

I perused your post history and still think you're a troll. I think the main reason I think this is because you clearly don't understand the reasons Trump fans love Trump.

You think we're ""blinded"", which is your prerogative. But I don't believe for a second that your intent was to have a rational discussion about Trump, because if you did you would have tried to understand why we love him.

So yea, his personal morality is his to deal with. The country is doing quite well. This is in spite of the people who cannot handle getting their way.  "
1365,"Here’s my honest take on that tape.

After all that hee-hawing in the bus, he got out and was respectful to the girl that was going to interview him. I am a firm believer in what a private citizen says in private is PRIVATE.

He also said “they let you do it” 

Everything in that conversation was disgusting but it shows that he is just a normal guy. After the politicians and the media and Hollywood came out against that all, it all came out that THEY were the ones that actually do the “without their consent” stuff.

Also, I live and work in a liberal bastion of sunshine and warm happy feelings. The people I know and interact with all acted appalled. They don’t realize that I also see that they talk and act that way on a day-in, day-out basis. This goes for male and female, straight and gay. I really need to be spared the “only pigs talk like that” nonsense from them. It’s a bunch of feigned, fake outrage.

Now think about the timing of the tape. The Media was the mouth and ears of the Clinton Campaign. They released this tape at a time for maximum damage. They did it because they knew she was losing. 

If you had talked to me at any point during last election season, you would have seen me say that Hillary had a 0% chance of winning, and it wasn’t because I loved Trump and hated her. I saw what was about to happen. I watched CNN election night because I wanted to see Van Jones’s reaction when Trump won. The release of that tape had nothing to do with showing how “disgusting” the blue-collar billionaire business man playboy from NY was. It was to get Hillary Clinton elected, and it failed. 

It failed

1366,"Playboys, rockstars, actors... they all have their groupies and hangers-on who lust after powerful men. Some women gravitate toward that lifestyle/mentality. These women will LET you do just about anything to them. Note the word 'LET'. 'LET' means consent. Those are the words Trump used. These sorts of women will let you do anything, like grab them by the pussy. Hardly elloquent words but it was a private conversation. If some oldschool rocker said the same thing everyone would just roll their eyes and ignore it. "
1367,"We don’t worship people, it’s about their ideas and platform. The left doesn’t have that, they only have projection, sensationalism, and identity politics. We have allegiance to our nation and its values.

Trump is one of the only people in politics in a long time who passionately respects and wants to uphold these unique American liberties and  values. And also is strong and powerful enough to combat the corrupt political elite that exist on both sides, who serve globalist billionaires rather than the people they’re elected to serve. That is much more important than him saying mildly crude remarks about what some women will let rich and famous men do to them.

How do you feel about Bill Clinton using his intern’s vagina as a cigar holder? It’s pure cognitive dissonance to pretend to be outraged at Trump stating many women get off to and will do pretty much anything for a wealthy man (see: 50 shades, Hollywood culture in general, etc.) compared to actual rape and sexual misconduct by a sitting President (or that president’s wife invalidating and intimidating his victims)."

Didn't read your original post before it was removed, but a car is a privilege. A firearm is a protected Constitutional human right. Even in the most gun friendly state, there is a process for buying a firearm. Despite what dipstick was saying in the recent WH stream, you will not pick one in 5 minutes with an expired ID. You will fill out, at minimum, a 4473, and that information will be sent electronically to the NICS DB for a background check. It returns a Pass, a Fail, or Hold. If you are 19, you won't be able to purchase a handgun. Other states have other procedures, but that's the most easy it'll get. "

1600,"Cruz would not have been allowed to purchase guns if it wasn't for terrible Obama administration policy.

Robert Runcie is the Broward County Superintendent and the man credited with getting these policies changed. Policies that would have previously seen a kid like Cruz arrested.

Before Robert Runcie was Broward County Superintendent, he worked in the Chicago Public Schools system. He served as chief of staff to the board of education under Arne Duncan.

Arne Duncan was Obama's unpopular Secretary of Education.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Duncan

>Arne Starkey Duncan[1] (born November 6, 1964) was the United States Secretary of Education from 2009 through December 2015.[2][3] While his tenure as Secretary was marked by varying degrees of opposition from both social conservatives and teachers unions, he nevertheless enjoyed strong support from the US president who appointed him, Barack Obama. 

>Conservatives and some parents resisted Duncan's push for all U.S. states to adopt the Common Core Standards to determine what students had learned, and most US teachers unions disliked his emphasis on the use of data from student tests to evaluate teachers and schools.[4] Despite antagonism to the changes Duncan had introduced, Obama praised his work at the Department of Education by saying, ""Arne has done more to bring our educational system -- sometimes kicking and screaming -- into the 21st century than anybody else.""[5]

Robert Runcie changed Broward County schools policies drastically, within his first two years:

>Runcie says the numbers show the program is working. Expulsions and suspensions are down by about 60 percent, while arrests have dropped by 50 percent.

http://archive.is/unA3M

But that just means less are getting punished, not that most kids transformed.
Obama and Duncan adopted Runcie's policies.

>“Some of my staff joke that the Obama administration might have taken our policies and framework and developed them into national guidelines,” says Runcie. “What we’ve got is very aligned with that. We went out early on."""

if its about stopping mentally ill people, use the fucking rules in place now that prevent the mentally ill from possessing guns.  put the blame and punishment on the agencies that do not report the problems to the very database that is designed to PREVENT psychopaths like the shooter from getting guns.

You were banned because you don’t understand what people’s rights are. Your post was imbecilic even for an indoctrinated child, let alone a grown adult with two children. 

Imagine if a gay person said the same things you said about the gay couple who are unlucky enough to be your neighbors. 
“I have two adopted children and there’s a straight couple who live just upstairs. They’re always all over each other all the time when they’re outside. I’ve asked them to stop showing so much affection towards each other in public but they acted as if they just blew me off. For example, while my kids were outside they had their arms wrapped around each others’ waists. I don’t hate straight people, I just don’t want to expose my children to that type of lifestyle.” 

That gay person would be (rightly) called out by everyone saying how moronic they are, how being straight isn’t a “lifestyle,” and how the straight couple are free to do what they wish romantically (as long as it’s not too inappropriate[which, by your account, it wasn’t inappropriate at all]) outside, seeing as they live in the great country of America and they have the same freedoms as anyone else. 

And now you’re trying to twist the situation to seem like you’re the victim. 

Shame on you. I sincerely home that the couple you have been complaining about finds better neighbors sometime soon. You don’t deserve ANY sympathy because you refuse to give people respect simply because of the fact that they’re into the same gender. 

Also, how ironic would it be if one of your kids ended up being gay? Just a thought, but I’m genuinely curious if A.) you would blame them “catchin’ the gay” on this gay couple unfortunate enough to live near you, and B.) if you would treat your child any differently if they came out as gay to you.

You will really only score points with her if you go somewhere and genuinely give your opinion and get banned. My 5 year old son could get banned from a Reddit for intentionally trying to. "

1756,I am trying to get banned here
1757,"Yeah, but why? If you wanted to get banned it wouldn’t be hard to push the envelope to get banned.

Most people that come here to get banned will come here and post or say something so outrageous so as to ensure greeting banned, then run back somewhere else and say “see I told you they were fascists, they banned me”. But they were just trying to get banned, then play it off like the mods here are some sort of Nazis and there is no free speech and  “see how bad the people I don’t agree with are” to their friends, or more commonly comrades. 

So if your trying to get banned, you must not be trying very hard, and if you wanted to see if you could come here and be genuine and see if you will get banned, unless your a communist, you won’t. "

1815,"That’s very true. This entire thing in Florida was a manufactured failure of government on every level in order to enact some form of gun legislation. The promise program is an SJW Obama era policy that allowed this shooting to occur. 

Trump saying “take the guns first due process later” is what people are worried about. If Obama said that we would all be calling for impeachment. "
1816,"Again, he's referring to law that already exists and was ignored."
1817,I know that and many of his supporters know that but gun legislation is a slippery slope. In Russia they use to take guns from people they classified as mentally ill. Then they can say anyone who disagrees with the government is mentally ill. The democrats will take a mile if Trump gives them an inch.

A GO also has a security detail with him (seen behind him).  What's unusual is that he has no helmet on or vest while carrying a long rifle. Also, a GO usually carries a 9mm, which would probably play better in this image anyway. If he's carrying a long rifle under these conditions, he's probably trying to send a specific message, either through the media or to the gathering he is going to, but the message is intended for the local media, not CNN.

2243,The assault weapons of 1789
2244,Tally ho lads
2245,does that include auto cannons 
2246,Right. Elitist liberals only want their bodyguards to have guns.

Go back to you cave."
2254,"Well if you want to dive into that terminology it actually originated in WW2 via the German word ""Sturmgewehr"" (which translates to ""assault rifle"")

The modern definition is a selective fire weapon that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazines.

Its important to note that popular sporting rifles such as the AR-15 are not Assault Rifles due to the fact that they lack selective fire capabilities. 

Many firearm manufacturers also use the term for branding. 

Assault rifle is definitely a thing."

But the goal is, of course, make idiot think that what he's carrying is totes the same as a semi-automatic ar-15 or something."

2275,"Assault rifle has an actual definition though.

""An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine""

CNN is just trying to confuse people into thinking assault weapon = assault rifle. 

I really wish someone would take a tactical looking ar 15 and put it next to one with wood furniture and see if liberals think its a safer different gun. "
2276,"You're thinking of assault weapon which isn't real and is just a scary, black rifle. Assault rifles are very real and are select fire rifles that use an intermediate cartridge.

BUT - I'd prefer to spend the rest of my life free and not a felon. Concealed is concealed until you get in an accident or have a cop randomly stop you because you ""matched a description"". It happens"
2292,"Yeah I don’t give a fuck. Luckily I don’t need to worry about it considering I live in one of the most lax states. But even if I lived in Comifornia I’d conceal if I needed to.

Basically if my options are, (1)break the law and risk jail/fines to protect myself or (2) Be completely at the mercy of gangbangers/thugs/opportunists/creeps/mentally insane/etc.. I’ll go with the first option every time."

2303,Crowder basically did that in one of his videos. People were fine with anything with wood on them.
2304,"i stand corrected. i think its because its not an civillian term. its a millitary term for these weapons. the select fire would indicate a full auto which is illegal and not on the markets outside of pre 69 ban. also theres all ready an industry term available, An automatic rifle. i was tought there are rifles handguns shotguns and muzzleloaders. in semi auto, automatic single shot, leveraction, and bolt action. all class of personal firearm fit these catagorizations. assault rifle is kinda just a misleading scary term."

Happy thanks giving pede."
2309,Assault weapons are a term made up by the msm to make civilian weapons sound ominous. there is no such thing as an assault weapon becaise it does not define anything specificly. what is a assault weapon are all weapons assault weapons are just scary black rifles assault weapons? do tell what an assault weapon is because in the english language we define terms.

2311,"Why would a cop frisk you or toss your car if you’re polite, reasonable, and not a dangerous criminal?

It’s a fantasy. No one will fuck with you if you behave like a civilized person, and your life is more important than the myth of the all-seeing state"
2312,"Nothing you mentioned “just happens”, it is 100% preventable . You are the product of your own actions, You are the sole reason you are in every place or situation in your life. So if you are not smart enough while in possession of a firearm to have the basic situational awareness needed to not put your self into a “random situation” then you shouldn’t be carrying a gun even if it was legal. Seriously everything you just said would just take 2 seconds of effort to cover yourself from happening: Under seat pistol safes are made for that exact purpose and just takes 2 seconds before you drive off.


I live in the most gun friendly state in the country that you don’t even need a permit to conceal or open carry any weapon you want. There are the places like banks, courthouse, schools you can’t carry in, and private businesses have the right to make it illegal to carrying there if properly posted. That being said in 15 years I have never not had a gun with me outside of my home with the only exceptions being somewhere or doing something with zero possibility of finding myself, wife, or kid in a “random” situation in which would require a gun. So with that being said never out of the millions of times I wasn’t supposed too, I have never been vulnerable to any situation to get in trouble."
2313,"Praise the Lord, pede.

Then you must praise the pistol."
2314,"Just not living in California or somewhere like it in the first place solves or reduces a lot of those problems -- legality of carrying, gangbangers/thugs, etc.  Just being somewhere else gets you off of the X.  "
2315,"Incoming felony carry and murder charges. 

Personally I'd rather be dead than at the mercy of gangbangers/thugs/etc in Federal prison. "
2316,If they gave me a felony for it I would just acquire illegal guns after. In most states carrying without a permit is a misdemeanor too. And if you use your gun in obvious self defense its possible you won't even get asked for a permit because you aren't in the wrong. Don't really care either way. Im going to carry a gun no matter what. 
2317,I feel really stupid now. I change my opinion to one of agreement.
2318,We need to ban full retards and those things that go up.
2319,"Definitely a noncombatant but not a soldier.   Soldiers fight.  Chaplains do not fight and do not carry weapons, and in fact are not allowed -- in the Army, at least -- to carry weapons or engage in combat.  An Army medic is a noncombatant soldier, because medics do basic combat training and carry weapons, but are supposed to use them only in self defense.  Chaplains are not permitted to bear arms at all as part of their service.  That's why they get real soldiers appointed to them as assistants.

Since they're not trained as soldiers, armed as soldiers, or permitted to fight as soldiers, and AFAIK don't even have to pass a PT test, I don't see how you call yourself a soldier, unless you were a real soldier first, then became a chaplain.

And you don't use guns as defense. Defense means to resist an attack. This is blocking attacks not counter-attacking. Do you know anything about fighting for instance? 

Shooting someone is an OFFENSIVE move, not a DEFENSIVE move. Guns aren't used as a form of defense. They are a way to counter-attack. So yes shooting someone is assault. Again that's not always a bad thing, but don't pretend it's anything else. "
2348,"You're the one thats claiming everything is 100% preventable and the product of you own actions. 


What happened to me is that I was riding my bike, legally, with a group of friends. We rode every Friday evening after work from our bike shop. This particular evening it got dark after just an hour or so of riding and as we passed by on our normal route, two cop cars cut off our group and diverted some off to the right and me and my friend Ben went off to the left. We both parked our bikes but before we could dismount the cops tackled us over the bikes and put us in the dirt. We were then frisked and questioned and were detained for over an hour. They eventually let me go and then stopped me again just to fuck with me. I ended up getting home and never was charged with anything. 

How was that preventable?"

2585,soy boy drama queer
2586,"Well, it’s like what President Trump said... they know what they signed up for. My whole family serves/has served in the military, with the realization that if war broke out, they would be called out to fight. If you joined the military just to get the GI Bill and a steady paycheck with the expectation of never having to go to war, then maybe you shouldn’t have joined (remember, our military forces are voluntary, not drafted)."
2587,God bless our millatry.
2588,"When was anything involving the US armed forces a joke?  They don't put people through boot camp because combat is some kind of comedy club.  Soldiers die just in training.  Why would the US risk killing its troops in training, unless they had to be ready for some very serious stuff?   
  
War is Hell. Anyone who ever told you something different was lying.  The basic rules haven't changed in thousands of years.  Even if you aren't going for an all out battle, you prepare to be ready for one.  If the enemy calls your bluff and you aren't ready, shit goes downhill fast.  At the level played by the USA, there is no bluffing.     
  
Trump put a king and an ace on the table and told Syria and its supporters to back down.  The call ups are the jacks, the queens and all the other cards necessary to have back to back royal flushes if Putin wants to try and call Trump's move a bluff.    
  
It ain't happening.  Putin is smart enough, and his intelligence and our intelligence ""leaks"" let him clearly know that the USA isn't bluffing.  Putin will expel some diplomats or some other minor move.    
  
I have friends and family over there.  Some have been out there for numerous tours.  They aren't complaining, and even when it is a ""quiet"" day, we still pray for their safety, because evil people are looking for the opportunity to kill them every single fucking day.

2728,"I appreciate the chance to have a conversation. I can answer with my own feelings.
1. I always saw Obama as portraying himself in a certain way. That he should be admired, revered and idolozed. His supporters exclaimed the same and treated him as such. So to find out something like an affair with a pornstar would be a shock and seem hypocritical. Trump has been in the public eye for 30+ years. 3 marriages, affairs, tabloid stories, etc. Access Hollywood tape didn't stop ppl from voting this latest Stormy thing doesn't change minds either. He has been the same for decades so there is no shock value. We knew what we were voting for and his agenda superseded that. "

He is directly engaged with the public and give us an insight of how washington has been operating and calling out all bullshit, he is draining the swamp.

 he comes across as a guy who loves this country and really wants to make it great for all, he is putting America first and giving us a stepping stone to say to the rest of the world, "" we are proud to be Americans"". 

Trump is a Brick through the window of washington, tossed in by us, the American public. because we are tired of the same old nonsense we been putting up for years in washington. Democratic party and the DNC has been hijacked, bought and paid for by the rich globalist that undermine America and they are pulling the strings. past 8 years The democrats gutted this country of Jobs, our military and spent billions of U.S. dollars in foreign aid when we should be investing in our own backyard, America. They flat out assault our constitution. I am in favor of a smaller and effective government (conservative) 

Trump is a breath of fresh air, he is holding people accountable for their negligence, he is hitting hurdle after hurdle because he is against the establishment and deep state.  he is putting American back to work. Making America Center stage.

But then again, the public school system is falling to pieces, supplies given to the kids to use are 10-15 years outdated, inner city public high schools have graduation rates averaging around 30%, and teachers get paid next to nothing 

On the state of police in America; aren’t liberals (specifically black liberals) incredibly disappointed with how police treat certain people of color? Is there not widespread corruption in the police force? Isn’t the job of a police officer/firefighter considered to be “noble professions” bc the pay isn’t that of say a corporate job? 

So hell, fuck it; let’s let the govt pay for our hospitals, our doctors, and pay for all of the medical needs of American citizens and watch healthcare in America crash and burn just like the state of our public school system and police departments.

2763,"I’ve never met a conservative that doesn’t believe in climate change. The biggest thing that I see questioned is how much is man made vs the natural climate cycle and secondly how much of an impact will these green initiatives actually have on the environment in comparison to their cost in dollars, freedom, and lifestyle. Before we go into deals like the Paris agreement and give excessive powers to beurocrats and government entities that aren’t elected (EPA) in the name of climate change I would like to see a broader and more transparent discussion on the matter. There has been far too much disinformation on both sides. "

2767,"There used to be a conservative organization called the Boy Scouts, and one of the basic things they taught was conservation.  The Outdoor Code of the Boy Scouts ended with the line, ""Be conservation minded.""  As a general way of life they taught the boys to conserve resources and not leave a mess for other people to clean up.

Conservatives are not against conservation and they are not against clean air and they are not against being good stewards of the earth and sky. They just don't want these principles to be used as political weapons to force everyone to live according to the trendy virtue of the day."
2768,"No wonder people are at odds when the most prolific info dispensers are politicians and the media. 

The whole arena of public debate on climate changes is a witch’s brew drawn from a poisoned well it seems impossible to make sense of. Too many emotions, half-truths, agendas and outright lies on both sides. 

Personally, I believe the climate is in a warming trend, but... it’s been warming for quite a while and it’s also been a lot warmer. However, there appears to be a correlation with mankind’s increased development and carbon output, so I feel there’s likely a link. That’s not even to say that the entirety of what’s driving temperatures up. 

However, I don’t believe the governments of the world have the answer for it. Government is full of corrupt assholes on both sides. Do you really think so called liberals all believe in climate change and government intervention and conservatives don’t? I think it’s far more likely to believe they just echo the opinion of whoever gives them money. Like how John Kerry was “for the Iraq war, before I was against it,” or Obama ran on marriage was only between a man and a woman, until Joe Biden screwed up and Obama miraculously saw the light. 

Basically, IMO, there’s enough there to think humanity’s activity is exacerbating what may be a naturally occurring trend. Do I believe government has the only answer? Absolutely not. Do I believe government is using this matter as an opportunity for its own nefarious ends? Absolutely. 

In the 70’s, it was global cooling. When I was a kid, it was the hole in the O-zone layer. Those scenarios either never materialized, or were easily solved. Then it was global warming. Their estimates were off, so now it’s just climate change, which is actually what I’ve heard it described as since the 80’s, but it’s not as scary sounding, but it covers all the bases so they can’t be proven wrong again. 

I live in California and the REAL environmentalists are sick of the politicians here. You never see it in the National News and it barely gets mentioned locally, but so many local laws and regulations do more harm than good. It’s all window dressing. The government does NOT care. Especially liberal governments. The take the cash, cut the ribbons, plant a ceremonial tree and nothing changes. 

Why are the global governments trying to limit economic prosperity when that is the best thing that can happen for the planet? A prosperous nation has less children, that’s good for the environment, right? Prosperity leads to education and innovation, without which there would be no environmentally friendly solutions. It was only the prosperous western nations that developed solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, etc. 

I’m ashamed to say that I caught an episode of Vice on HBO a couple months ago and they were showing how in Nigeria, people steal crude oil to sell on the black market. The army came in and destroyed all the barrels of oil, polluting the soil and rivers. Villagers dig pits and fill them with oil at night and light them on fire to keep warm. So what do we do, send our money over there so their politicians get richer while the people dig bigger pits? Or do we keep working, inventing and investing until we can provide them with cheap energy instead of just pallets of cash? Ironically, that’s one thing they won’t burn. 

On the front page of reddit there’s an article every day about some new barrier being broken or some sustainability goal reached “despite Trump trying to kill the environment.” If you ask me, sounds like Trump is pretty good for the environment because either through hate or through inspiration, he gets people motivated, and a mass of motivated people are far more effective and powerful than any corrupt government on the face of the planet. 

On a side note, here’s and [article](https://m.washingtontimes.com) about a Cornell University study showing how climate change “skeptics” are more environmentally friendly than “alarmists.” The study is titled “Believing in climate change but not behaving sustainably.” That whole individual accountability vs. government reliance that splits the left and right. 

We’re getting there. We can fix this. Not *them.*

Also, if the governments of the world and the media cared so much, where are the nightly stories about the very real and tangible threat of global overfishing? That’s just one very real and observable calamity this planet faces, but since it’s not an invisible boogie man that can get people to invest in carbon credits or diminish their lives, you never hear about it. 

I grew up under the existential threat of global thermonuclear annihilation. It was a cloud over everyone’s head. “Trust us,” said the government. Same thing as they say now, except they replaced the uranium atom with one of carbon. 

Trump is not your enemy. Obama is not your friend. Politicians are not the answer and...

2812,"Im with you on this one. The cult took 27 years of my life. Anyone who wants facts on the religion, I am open. The founder Joseph Smith is an actual pedophile (married a 14 year old and other teens) who also married other men’s wives. He was put in jail many times for fraud and most notoriously for burning down someone’s place of business because he proposed to the guy’s wife and so the husband was going to expose him for the horny con artist he was. He then later got in a gunfight at Carthage jail which led to his death. Fact check me.

Furthermore the early prophets of the church recommend killing your spouse if they cheat on you because death is the only way to “atone” for some sins. Also.  Brigham young said that anyone who gets married to a “negro” should be put to death on the spot. 

Mormonism is a cult. Check out CESletter.com for more. 

Edit: I also served a full time Mormon mission and got married in the temple. If you want to see the cult rituals look up newnamenoah on YouTube. Specifically the prayer circle but they are all batshit crazy. Anyone who says that it is fake is full of it. I have sadly done all of that and it was some of the most uncomfortable times of my life.

Or how ""black or red skin was a curse from god and if you were righteous you could be white"". Or how there used to be a part of the oaths that had you slitting your neck. I saw those cult rituals. They're a joke haha lots of veils, white robes, and clenching of fists while giving passwords."
2816,Are you hurt that they stopped contributing to the ze scouts of America? 
2817,You are more right than you know. Joseph Smith cucked over so many men in the literal term. He often sent men on mission overseas and then married their wives. 
2818,"Oh. I touched on the tip of the iceberg on my post. I’ve sadly had to become a mini expert on church history to convince myself and in-indoctrinate my mind. To be fair, 90% of active Mormons have no idea about any of this. It is not openly taught and often completely regarded as anti Mormon material. It is called whitewashing. "

2821,I figured! Everything I have seen on them is that they are kept in the dark on the true history or the negatives and explained away by the bishops. Oh and for our Jewish friends on here how about all those baptisms for the dead holocaust victims the church thought it was okay to do even after they said it wasn't?
2822,Well your braindead drivel isn't going to fly here.
2823,Yep. Adolph hitler was also baptized for the dead in the early 90’s and there is speculation from a reliable source that there is hidden footage of them doing Muhammad’s baptism as well. He is afraid to post it because of the ramifications it could bring.

Not sure what's up with the several posts here today in T_D trying to get us to stop using a phrase that literally mentions the guilty party (the Dems) in the phrase.

I just don't see how you get from ""Democrat plantation"" to ""I'm gonna run away from the Republicans and towards the Democrats"".

EDIT: 

>We're trying to convince more black people to join us and the language we use... brings up images of slavery?

That's like saying that Republicans who addressed the issue of slavery in the 1800s, shouldn't have brought it up bc it would somehow make black people run in the opposite direction towards the Dems. It just makes no sense at all. If the phrase was ""Republican plantation"" then obviously that would be connecting the word ""plantation"" to the word ""Republican"", which would be bad. But we're connecting the word to the Dems—which, anyone who hears the phrase and is the least bit curious, will quickly realize after a quick Internet search that it was the *Dems* who were the slaveowners to begin with. A lot of normie Dems have no clue; they think the Republicans were always ""the bad guys"". The phrase ""Democrat plantation"" is both an apt metaphor, it names the guilty party, and it also makes people's ears perk up and arouses their curiosity, if they know nothing about the history of slavery in the US. It's a red pill."

Instead of talking about firearm safety training in the 70’s they introduced the phrase “assault weapons”. Instead of talking about why we couldn’t vote over the phone in the 80’s they introduced the phrase “demographic polling”. That instead of talking about access by-the-public to raw-government-data in the 90’s they introduced the phrase “information super highway”?
